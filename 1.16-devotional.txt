<h1>Our Heavenly Father Cares</h1>

<p>"Look at the birds of the air, that they do not sow, nor reap, nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth much more than they?" - Matthew 6:26</p>

<p>Sometimes we just need a reminder... Our heavenly Father loves us and takes care of us. This could be compared to how a loving parent loves their child...</p>

<p>"Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks for a loaf, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he? If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask Him!" - Matthew 7:7-11</p>

<p>In need of anything? PRAY! God is listening! Yes, even if you have done wrong, PRAY. He is listening and will forgive you and welcome you back into His arms always!</p>

<p>Rest assured, we have a God who has great care and love towards us. He has wonderful plans for our lives here and the next!</p>
