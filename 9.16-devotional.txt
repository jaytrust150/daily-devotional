  <h1>Guarding the Gospel: The Unchanging Message of Salvation</h1>

  <p>“But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!” - Galatians 1:8</p>

  <p>“Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.” - 1 Corinthians 15:1-4</p>

  <p>The Gospel, as quoted above, God's message to the world delivered by His apostles, was simple. God died for our sins and was resurrected on the third day. Even if an angel or “prophet” were to try to change the message (which has happened with the rise of several different religions), the Bible tells us to let them be accursed. Do not believe them, is the warning.</p>
