  <h1>Overcoming: Sitting with Christ on His Throne</h1>

  <p>“The one who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat with My Father on His throne.” - Revelation 3:21</p>

  <p>The following is a promise given by Jesus. He promises that he who “overcomes” will be granted to “sit” on His “throne”! There are several other promises given to those Christians who “overcome.”</p>

  <p>Funny thing is, everyone wants to be an overcomer, but they don’t want anything to overcome.</p>

  <p>Lord, give us wisdom and patience to “overcome!”</p>
