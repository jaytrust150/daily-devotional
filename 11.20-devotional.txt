  <h1>Strengthened with Power: A Prayer for Inner Strength</h1>

  <p>"For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name, that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner man." - Ephesians 3:14-16 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>The above is what Paul prayed as he bowed his knees. It's a good prayer we should also pray.</p>

  <p>Father God, grant us to be strengthened with power through Your Spirit in the inner man!</p>

  <p>Amen!</p>

  <p>Why did Paul make this prayer? It's the same reason why I prayed it, too. Read the rest of the chapter to find out! If you have time, read the book of Ephesians; it's pretty short.</p>
