  <h1>Overcoming: A Promise and a Reward</h1>

  <p>“He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.” - Revelation 2:7</p>

  <p>To him who overcomes, Jesus will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.</p>

  <p>It’s interesting when you read these promises found in Revelation addressed to the churches, plural. Although God, prior, is giving a rebuke specifically to a local church (Jesus called the church according to the city/its location, the reason I am saying local church) in each section, the Spirit, however, is clearly talking to all the churches...“what the Spirit says to the churches.”</p>

  <p>My favorite pastor, Erwin Lutzer, recently taught on “being an overcomer” a few days ago, and it really fired me up and encouraged me to “overcome” certain things I struggle with before in the past. It’s interesting how the word is presented; it could either be life or death to a believer. When I first learned about being an “overcomer,” it was death to my Christian walk because it wasn’t presented as a reward for those who overcome but more as a punishment for those Christians who don’t. This was terrible and borderline “wicked” (to slander brothers and sisters or other Christian churches that were not meeting with them and saying they are anti-Christ were other things these brothers erroneously taught and perhaps still teach). I’m sure those brothers have good intentions, but they were a stumbling block for a large portion of my Christian walk, and I’m sure to others as well. It is only recently, thank God and Pastor Lutzer, that I have been able to “overcome” this prior introduction to such a wonderful teaching. Anyway, not to be negative, but for it to serve as a warning for those reading this.</p>

  <p>On to the good stuff: knowing that God will specially bless those of us who “overcome” has led me to want to grow more in my Christian walk. Praise be to God!</p>

  <p>To God be the glory!</p>
