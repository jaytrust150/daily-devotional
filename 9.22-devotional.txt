  <h1>Winning Through Loss: The Paradox of Christian Victory</h1>

  <p>“Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Just as it is written, ‘FOR YOUR SAKE WE ARE BEING PUT TO DEATH ALL DAY LONG; WE WERE CONSIDERED AS SHEEP TO BE SLAUGHTERED.’ But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” - Romans 8:35-39</p>

  <p>The longer I live, the more I realize how true the Bible is. I mean, when I was young, I believed there was a God, but now that I am older, I know there is a God. I've always been ahead of the “class” when it came to education. By the time I graduated high school, I already had half a year of college done, finished Calculus I and II, and was pretty much done with all the “hard” math I had to take to become a high school math teacher before I even graduated high school, lol (that's what I became, a teacher).</p>

  <p>What is the point? Well, it's that the Lord made me wise and intelligent beyond my years. (I prayed about being smart when I failed 2nd grade, lol. Thank God He answered my prayer!) Anyway, the point is that God has taught me so much throughout my life. And one thing that is kind of an oxymoron (contradiction) is that Christians are winning even when it seems we are losing. It's the verse I started this devotional with.</p>

  <p>Don't be fooled; the Bible is quite clear: it's not those who celebrate in this life who are winning. It's those who mourn and weep now, for they shall be comforted (Matthew 5:4).</p>

  <p>Anyhow, I hope that serves as an encouragement.</p>

  <p>“Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; and others experienced mocking and flogging, and further, chains and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented (of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts, mountains, and caves and holes in the ground. And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised, because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.” - Hebrews 11:35-40</p>

  <p>“Peace be unto you. Let us always remember the power of prayer to the Father in the name of the Son (Jesus) through the power of the Holy Spirit. Amen.” - Rev. Daniel J. Johnson</p>
