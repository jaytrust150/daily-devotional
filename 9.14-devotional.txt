  <h1>Love Fulfills the Law: Caring for Others in a Selfish World</h1>

  <p>“Do to others as you would have them do to you.” - Luke 6:31</p>

  <p>“Love does no harm to its neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.” - Romans 13:10</p>

  <p>Two verses worth thinking about, especially in this day and age when some people just stop caring about each other.</p>
