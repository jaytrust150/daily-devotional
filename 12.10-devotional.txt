  <h1>The Mystery of God: A Plan Revealed</h1>

  <p>"and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, WHO CREATED HEAVEN AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE EARTH AND THE THINGS IN IT, AND THE SEA AND THE THINGS IN IT, that there will be delay no longer" - Revelation 10:6</p>

  <p>Eventually, there will be a point in time when God will wrap things up. The next verse tells us, "then the mystery of God is finished."</p>

  <p>What is the mystery of God? It's been God's plan from the foundation of the universe. The offer is still available to all who choose to believe in Jesus as Lord.</p>
