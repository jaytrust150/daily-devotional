  <h1>The Fleeting Nature of Riches: Guarding Your Testimony</h1>

  <p>“Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” - Romans 12:21</p>

  <p>“But the brother of humble circumstances is to glory in his high position; and the rich man is to glory in his humiliation, because like flowering grass he will pass away. For the sun rises with a scorching wind and withers the grass; and its flower falls off and the beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so too the rich man in the midst of his pursuits will fade away.” - James 1:9-11</p>

  <p>It’s interesting where the following verse is located, in the book of James, but more importantly in a section that has to deal with temptation. See, money indeed is one of those temptations that has and can lead many people astray. But the wisdom found in Scripture is that money is fleeting; it’s like the flowering grass that withers in the sun.</p>

  <p>Don’t let the temptation to get “money” make you ruin or mess up your testimony—not worth it!</p>

  <p>This section of Scripture is a good read!</p>

  <p>“But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” - James 1:5</p>

  <p>“Money does a lot, but nowhere near what respect could do.” - Jada Kiss</p>
