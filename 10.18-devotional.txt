  <h1>Transformed by the Word: Growing in Grace</h1>

  <p>"But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit." - 2 Corinthians 3:18</p>

  <p>One of the best things about being a Christian is seeing the way the Lord has transformed us! I feel so thankful when I can see a difference in my person compared to how I used to be. GROWING!</p>

  <p>"Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord." - 1 Peter 2:1-3</p>
