  <h1>Simeon's Song: A Light for Revelation</h1>

  <p>"And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. ... 'Now, Lord, You are letting Your bond-servant depart in peace, According to Your word; For my eyes have seen Your salvation, Which You have prepared in the presence of all the peoples: A light for revelation for the Gentiles, And the glory of Your people Israel.'" - Luke 2:26, 29-32 (NASB20)</p>

  <p>Jesus is the Messiah (Christ), the promised seed to Abraham that would bless all the nations! The verses above are a snippet from Simeon (the verse below describes who was talking):</p>

  <p>"And there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him." - Luke 2:25 (NASB20)</p>
