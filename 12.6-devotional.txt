  <h1>Seeking and Saving the Lost: The Gospel for All</h1>

  <p>"For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost." - Luke 19:10</p>

  <p>"For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek." - Romans 1:16 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>We sometimes forget the Gospel originally came first to the Jewish people. (It's still rightfully theirs, and eventually, a sign of the end times is that they will accept the Gospel and spearhead it into all the nations, leading to the resurrection of the dead!)</p>

  <p>"I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? May it never be! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous. Now if their transgression is riches for the world and their failure is riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fulfillment be! But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, if somehow I might move to jealousy my fellow countrymen and save some of them. For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?" - Romans 11:11-15 (NASB95)</p>
