  <h1>Believe and Be Saved: The Simplicity of the Gospel</h1>

  <p>I never like to complicate the Gospel; it's pretty simple. You know you are a sinner if you've ever done wrong. God promises to forgive us our sins and promises us eternal life if we believe in His Son and what He did for us on the cross.</p>

  <p>"And after he brought them out, he said, 'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?' They said, 'Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.' And they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house." - Acts 16:30-32</p>

  <p>“Jesus came to seek and to save the lost. He is the Seeker; we are the ones who are running.” —R.C. Sproul</p>
