  <h1>The Lost Sheep: God's Pursuit of the Sinner</h1>

  <p>"Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming near Jesus to listen to Him. And both the Pharisees and the scribes began to complain, saying, 'This man receives sinners and eats with them.' And so He told them this parable, saying, 'What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the other ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? And when he has found it, he puts it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!' I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.'" - Luke 15:1-7</p>

  <p>In case you missed it, the sheep represent people. Jesus leaves the 99 righteous people to go out and find that one sinner that was lost. And when He has found him, He rejoices because they are back! They are back in the household of God. The other stories in the chapter tell the same story.</p>

  <p>Maybe you never knew you were "lost," and it took God sending out someone to go find you!</p>
