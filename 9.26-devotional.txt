  <h1>The Choice to Worship: God's Hiddenness and Future Revelation</h1>

  <p>“For it is written, ‘AS I LIVE, SAYS THE LORD, EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW TO ME, AND EVERY TONGUE SHALL GIVE PRAISE TO GOD.’” - Romans 14:11</p>

  <p>Have you ever heard people ask, “If God exists, why doesn't he reveal Himself now?”</p>

  <p>The truth is, God has chosen to give man the choice to choose between worshiping Him or not. This wouldn't be the case if God were to reveal Himself now. If we saw God, we would be left with no choice but to want to worship Him. There is coming a time when Jesus will be worshiped by all for who He is.</p>

  <p>“so that at the name of Jesus EVERY KNEE WILL BOW, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” - Philippians 2:10-11</p>
