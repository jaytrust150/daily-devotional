  <h1>Inspired by Paul: Reaching All People for the Gospel</h1>

  <p>
    “Though I am free and belong to no one, I have made myself a slave to everyone, to win as many as possible. 20 To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews. To those under the law I became like one under the law (though I myself am not under the law), so as to win those under the law. 21 To those not having the law I became like one not having the law (though I am not free from God’s law but am under Christ’s law), so as to win those not having the law. 22 To the weak I became weak, to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some. 23 I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that I may share in its blessings.” - 1 Corinthians 9:19-23

    The more I learn about Paul (he wrote what I’m quoting above, and several of the books found in the Bible), the more I’m impressed. 
    See, Paul went from persecuting Christians to being a man who would give it all for the Kingdom of God and its citizens. Paul “became all things to all people so that by all possible means” he “might save some.” He did it “for the sake of the gospel, that” he “may share in its blessings.”

    I guess my New Year’s resolution this year is to learn from Paul how to reach all people regardless of their background, race, color, or anything else, for the sake of the gospel and to eventually share in its blessings.

    “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” - John 3:16

    So why those hashtags? Because they are true regardless of what racist people tell you or regardless of how they treat you. The world is getting colder; people are definitely more wicked now. Don’t let that change you, but you change them. Light overcomes darkness, and love overcomes hate! In Jesus’ name, we will overcome! Amen.
