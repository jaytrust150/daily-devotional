  <h1>Worshiping in Spirit and Truth: Accessing the Spiritual Realm</h1>

  <p>"But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers. God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth." - John 4:23-24 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>The above is Jesus speaking. Once Christians are born again by the Spirit of God (John 3:5-8), we can "worship Him in spirit and truth." The "Him" is God, as referenced in the verse. The implication is that if we are to worship God, we "must" do so in "spirit" and "truth," as the verse above states.</p>

  <p>We have access to God through our spirit, not our soul or body (however, our worship is expressed through our soul and body). The body gives us access to the senses (touch, smell, taste, see, hear)—our physical world/realm. Our spirit gives us access to the spiritual world/realm, the Bible teaches, and our soul is where we process information, think about our thoughts, will, and emotions.</p>

  <p>"However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Him." - Romans 8:9 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>"Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own? For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body." - 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>A temple is used to worship God (we are called the temple of the Holy Spirit). Keep in mind the context of why I use the prior verses along with the one I started with above about worship (it’s all related to worship and our spirit).</p>

  <p>Anyhow, the Bible makes one thing clear: it’s that human beings have a “body, soul, and spirit,” which I quickly spoke about the function of each in this post.</p>

  <p>"Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass." - 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>Hopefully, I can touch upon this more. However, I want to drop this in by way of reminder:</p>

  <p>"For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life." - Galatians 6:8 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>You can read about the fruits of the “flesh” and the fruits of the “Spirit” in Galatians 5 to know what you actually reap from either (hint: flesh bad, spirit good).</p>

  <p>"If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit." - Galatians 5:25 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>As Christians, we are called to walk in the “Spirit.” I have heard it said that we should exercise our “spirit.”</p>

  <p>"Physical training is good, but training for godliness is much better, promising benefits in this life and in the life to come." - 1 Timothy 4:8 (NLT)</p>
