  <h1>God's Plans for You: A Future and a Hope</h1>

  <p>“‘For I know the plans that I have for you,’ declares the LORD, ‘plans for welfare and not for calamity to give you a future and a hope.’” - Jeremiah 29:11</p>

  <p>One thing we can be certain about is that the Lord always has our best interest in hand, whether it's putting us through the storm so that we learn a valuable lesson or blessing us with a blessing. One thing we know for certain as believers is that:</p>

  <p>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.” - Romans 8:29</p>
