  <h1>Eternal Life: A Secure Gift in Christ</h1>

  <p>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.” - 1 John 5:11-13</p>

  <p>Why am I stressing this point of the Gospel? Well, for one, it will clear up any false teaching regarding our position in Christ. It will set you free from religion and the lie that you can lose your salvation (what’s eternal, by definition, will not end).</p>

  <p>The most basic understanding of salvation comes with accepting what Christ did for you. Don't let any person tell you otherwise. Believe God’s Word and walk in newness of life!</p>

  <p>“I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand.” - John 10:28</p>
