  <h1>Becoming All Things to All People: The Purpose of Saving Some</h1>

  <p>"To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak; I have become all things to all men, so that I may by all means save some. I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I may become a fellow partaker of it." - 1 Corinthians 9:22-23 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>What's your life purpose? Mine is to draw all men to Jesus! To share the Gospel so "that I may by all means save some."</p>
