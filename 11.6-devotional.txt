  <h1>The Unknown God: Proclaiming the True God</h1>

  <p>"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ." - Romans 10:17</p>

  <p>Do you have faith in the God of the Bible? No, not faith in a "god," but specifically, the God whom the Bible proclaims? (Yes, there is a big difference between Him and the other gods people believe in, and YES, it matters.)</p>

  <p>Let me explain.</p>

  <p>Just like in the times when the Bible was first written (both Old and New Testaments), there are many gods being proclaimed now, similar to back then. For example, you have Allah from the Quran or Krishna from the Hindu religion, who clearly aren't Jesus Christ being proclaimed and portrayed as God. Jesus Christ, as you may or may not know, is described in the Bible as the "radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature" (Hebrews 1:3) in reference to God. So, in seeing Jesus, you get a glimpse of who God is (John 10:30), and what you learn is pretty awesome and very different from those gods I just finished mentioning from those other religions.</p>

  <p>When you learn about Jesus, you learn about this loving God who created creation, so we can begin to have a clue regarding His glory and who He is. I mean, it's just amazing who the God of the Bible is. The greatest accomplishment, the best feat, the most awesome thing that I've experienced as a human being is knowing the God of the Bible! I've been to China, traveled the world, and seen and done many marvelous things, but out of all those things, NOTHING compares with knowing the God of the Bible. Everything else is crap (poop) in comparison. I feel sorry for you if you don't get to know Him, and I don't say that in a disrespectful way. I truly mean it. I feel bad for you if you haven't gotten the pleasure to know Him. The saddest thing is, you don't even know what you are missing :(*.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, I went off on a tangent. Back to the point.</p>

  <p>Like Paul, I'd like to speak about the God of the Bible in light of these other gods people worship. I'll do so by quoting him on the topic as he addressed the "religious" people of his time when "his spirit was being provoked within him as he was observing the city full of idols" (Acts 17:16).</p>

  <p>This is what Paul had to say:</p>

  <p>“So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, 'Men of Athens, I observe that you are very religious in all respects. For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, 'TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.' Therefore what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you. The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands; nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all things; and He made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation, that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; for in Him we live and move and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, 'For we also are His children.' Being then the children of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and thought of man. Therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God is now declaring to men that all people everywhere should repent, because He has fixed a day in which He will judge the world in righteousness through a Man whom He has appointed, having furnished proof to all men by raising Him from the dead.'” - Acts 17:22-31</p>
