<h1>God's Faithfulness</h1>

<p>"I do not say this to condemn you; I have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you." - 2 Corinthians 7:3</p>

<p>"So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less?" - 2 Corinthians 12:15</p>

<p>Lord, let us learn to love the way Paul did (speaking above to the Corinthians), and more importantly, the way You do, with true faithfulness.</p> 

<p>Thank You, Lord, for always being faithful. Help us to be more faithful to You!</p>

<p>"If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself." - 2 Timothy 2:13</p>
