  <h1>True Riches: Seeking Heavenly Treasures, Not Worldly Trends</h1>

  <p>“The words of wise men are like goads, and masters of these collections are like well-driven nails; they are given by one Shepherd.” - Ecclesiastes 12:11</p>

  <p>God’s Word directs us!</p>

  <p>“It is the blessing of the LORD that makes rich, And He adds no sorrow to it.” - Proverbs 10:22</p>

  <p>“But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.” - Matthew 6:33</p>

  <p>To be clear, there is nothing wrong with money in itself.</p>

  <p>“For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” - 1 Timothy 6:10</p>

  <p>It’s the “love” of money that’s the problem.</p>

  <p>I’m rich, I feel, no kidding. Financially, most of us are “rich” compared to the majority of the world. In fact, our poorest of the poorest are still rich compared to the standards of third-world countries (the reason everyone wants to come to the US—even the poor people here are rich by comparison). The point of my earlier devotions is that we focus not on physical wealth, which is here one day and gone the next, but that we stack riches in heaven, where it really counts.</p>

  <p>An easy rule of thumb: if the world is chasing after it and telling you to go after it, chances are it’s wrong. Don't follow trends, follow Jesus!</p>

  <p>It’s interesting: the closest thing some people come to a Bible verse are these posts on social media or the daily Bible verse on the Bible app, and that is great, but there is so much more available!!! Read the Word! It’s the most important thing you will ever read!</p>

  <p>Lord, give us all more of a thirst and hunger for Your Word! In Your mighty name we pray. Jesus is Lord! Amen!</p>
