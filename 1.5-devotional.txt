  <h1>Render to God What is God's</h1>

  <p>
    Matthew 22:15-22
  </p>

  <p>
    Then the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap Him in what He said. 16 And they *sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any. 17 Tell us then, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?” 18 But Jesus perceived their malice, and said, “Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites? 19 Show Me the coin used for the poll-tax.” And they brought Him a [l]denarius. 20 And He *said to them, “Whose likeness and inscription is this?” 21 They *said to Him, “Caesar’s.” Then He *said to them, “Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and to God the things that are God’s.” 22 And hearing this, they were amazed, and leaving Him, they went away.

    God doesn't want your money... He wants you... "Then render to Caesar's the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's."

    Jesus taught that the coin was Caesar's because it had Caesar's inscription on it... the bible says we are created in God's image, so by Jesus' logic that means we are God's... we belong to Him for we were created in HIS image...
