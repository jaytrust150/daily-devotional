  <h1>Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God: The Names of Jesus</h1>

  <p>"For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace." - Isaiah 9:6-7</p>

  <p>Some of you are probably saying, "Wow, Jesus has a lot of names!" To be clear, God didn't want people to be confused about who Jesus is. "Mighty God," the text says. God, and as a result, the Bible, is very specific with everything. Even all the names of the characters in the Bible have meanings. Believe it or not, God's sovereignty (His will) even extends to the names parents would give their children at birth. If you look up the Hebrew names of the people in the Bible, you will learn how even their names give context to the stories you read about them.</p>

  <p>I'm sure your name has a special meaning, too. Google it!</p>
