  <h1>Born Again: A New Creation in Christ</h1>

  <p>“And put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.” - Ephesians 4:24</p>

  <p>“Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.” - 2 Corinthians 5:17</p>

  <p>When you become a Christian by faith (Ephesians 2:1-10), through the blood of Christ, you are cleansed (forgiven of all sin), and by the Spirit of God, you are born again.</p>

  <p>“The wind blows where it wishes and you hear the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.” - John 3:8</p>
