  <h1>God's Patience and Love: A Call to Repentance</h1>

  <p>"The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance." - 2 Peter 3:9</p>

  <p>If you're reading this, or any of my devotions, know that I have love for you! This is my way of showing it! I love you and want you to not perish!</p>

  <p>“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” - John 3:16</p>

  <p>I'm showing it by giving you these verses. God shows it by giving you His Son!</p>

  <p>"He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life." - 1 John 5:12</p>
