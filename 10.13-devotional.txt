  <h1>God's Sovereignty: Acknowledging His Control in All Things</h1>

  <p>"It has seemed good to me to declare the signs and wonders which the Most High God has done for me." - Daniel 4:2</p>

  <p>The above words are those of King Nebuchadnezzar. You find out in the book of Daniel about the king's life. You learn how God made the king learn, through terrible events, that despite the king ruling the known world, it was God who determined the course of things and that God truly was in charge of the world. We call this the sovereignty of God.</p>

  <p>So if you question, "Why is this happening to me?" I would suggest seeking God's guidance and learning what the king learned: that nothing happens to any of us unless God Almighty allows it. Therefore, when we acknowledge Him, we will hopefully one day also be able to declare that those terrible events are but signs and wonders which the Most High God has done.</p>

  <p>I know, reflecting on my life—losing it all, my sanity, everything bad that happened—that those were but signs and wonders of my God, and I'm now truly grateful for what He did, though at the time I wasn't.</p>

  <p>“Salvation is something that God does in us and for us, not something that we in any way do for ourselves.” —R.C. Sproul</p>

  <p>"To know that nothing happens in God’s world apart from God’s will may frighten the godless, but it stabilizes the saints." - J.I. Packer</p>
