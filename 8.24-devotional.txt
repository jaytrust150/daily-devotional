  <h1>Thankful for the Surpassing Value of Knowing Christ</h1>

  <p>“More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith.” - Philippians 3:8-9</p>

  <p>It only takes a few words to say, “thank you.” But those words have a lot of meaning. Thank you for everyone who has been a part of my life in one way or another. I’m grateful to know you and have you as a friend. Thank you to my God for being such a blessing all the days of my life.</p>

  <h2>Group Prayer</h2>

  <p>May God bless us to allow us to be a continual blessing to everyone we encounter daily. May we be a light to the nations and our neighborhoods as well, a walking testimony of what Jesus does to a changed life. Lord, please help each and every single one of us in whatever area of life we need you most. In your mighty name we pray, Lord Jesus, please hear our prayer, Amen!</p>
