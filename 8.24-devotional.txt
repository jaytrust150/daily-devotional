  <h1>Christ Came to Save Sinners</h1>

  <p>“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive compensation for his deeds done through the body, in accordance with what he has done, whether good or bad.” - 2 Corinthians 5:20</p>

  <p>“the manner of man he was on that day will be revealed…” It has been said that when we die and God goes over our lives, then that statement will be evident.</p>

  <p>“It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am foremost of all.” - 1 Timothy 1:15</p>

  <p>This is Paul, one of the writers of the Bible, speaking about his former life and declaring that Christ came into the world to save sinners. So if you’re not going to church because you say you are a sinner, or are living a bad lifestyle, I have good news for you! Christ came into the world to save sinners! Including both you and I 😃</p>
