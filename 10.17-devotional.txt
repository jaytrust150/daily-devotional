  <h1>The Joy of Salvation: Welcoming Sinners and Rejecting Legalism</h1>

  <p>“Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near Him to listen to Him. Both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble, saying, 'This man receives sinners and eats with them.' So He told them this parable, saying, 'What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!' I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.'" - Luke 15:1-7</p>

  <p>In the above verses, we hear Jesus addressing the "religious" people of His time with a parable (a simple story told to teach a lesson) because they "began to grumble" (complain) and were mad at Jesus for receiving sinners.</p>

  <p>Today, we find the same situation occurring. The Gospel is preached, and sinners are coming to God (Jesus) for salvation. He doesn't require them to jump through hoops or perform any religious activities to be saved. He doesn't force them to perform any pillars or do ANYTHING religious to be saved—just believe and have faith. Again, for emphasis, JESUS does NOT require us to sign up for a religious course or perform any religious work. All that is needed is faith. We are saved by grace through faith, not by works (needing to perform religious duties), and this makes religious people mad. It did back then, and it still does now. They say things like, "Jesus can't die for you! You mean to tell me you can do whatever you want and you are still going to heaven?"</p>

  <p>It’s quite shocking, but the answer to the above question is yes. However, it’s not what you think. lol. Just because I can do “whatever” I want and still go to heaven DOES NOT MEAN I WANT TO DO THOSE things you suppose I want to do.</p>

  <p>You see, the Christian faith is a “real thing.” It changes a person intrinsically (from the inside, naturally), so you are “a new creation” (2 Corinthians 5:17). This does NOT mean I all of a sudden stop doing wrong, but it does mean that I now have a desire to no longer do those things that I once did that were wrong, yet I used to still be okay with doing. Of course, your old friends might not get this and might talk crap; read 1 Peter 4:3-7 so you won't be surprised. Anyhow, to the Christian, salvation is easy (God takes care of it), but that does NOT mean we no longer struggle with past sins (1 Corinthians 9:27). In fact, the Bible and all of Scripture are used to help us make corrections and for training in righteousness.</p>

  <p>“All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness.” - 2 Timothy 3:16</p>

  <p>It’s important that we don't confuse the process of sanctification (becoming holy) with salvation. Paul labored to make this distinction clear to the early believers. Unfortunately, some churches even now still confuse the issue, and you get believers who believe they need to be sanctified (holy) before being saved (not true). This ultimately leads to them leaving the church because, unfortunately, sanctification isn't something we will fully accomplish in this lifetime, and they are so discouraged because they feel they are “failing” or that they will never be “saved.” They end up worse than they began. :/</p>

  <p>Hopefully, you understand this isn't true but a lie. “There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus!” we are told in Romans 8:1. Christ paid the price fully for our salvation! He reconciled (made peace/made our relationship right with) us to God.</p>

  <p>“Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation. Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” - 2 Corinthians 5:18-21</p>
