  <h1>The Promise of Eternal Life: Evidence and Transformation</h1>

  <p>"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life." - John 3:16</p>

  <p>Not perishâ€”that is the promise of God for those who believe in Christ!</p>

  <p>I understand that looking back now, thousands of years after the resurrection, it might be hard to believe in life after death. I mean, unlike the apostles who were eyewitnesses, what proof do we have?</p>

  <p>Well, for one, we have the testimonies of the apostles themselves, and history is on our side. Historians and historical texts outside of the Bible record the deaths of these men, some of whom even died terrible deaths for the name of Christ! Would you die for something you didn't believe happened? I would argue no, but these men clearly believed what transpired enough to give their lives for it. They claimed to have walked, talked, and even eaten with the Lord after His death.</p>

  <p>So while we might not be able to see Christ after His resurrection now, we are still able to see the fruit of His death. One only has to look at a life changed by the message of the Gospel to witness the power of the resurrection! The Bible claims that it is through His death that we are able to truly change.</p>
