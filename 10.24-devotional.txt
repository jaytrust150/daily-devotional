  <h1>Dead to the World, Alive in Christ: Freedom from Legalism</h1>

  <p>“If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees, such as, 'Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!' (which all refer to things destined to perish with use)—in accordance with the commandments and teachings of men? These are matters which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence.” - Colossians 2:21-23</p>

  <p>The older I grow, the more I realize how truly important and liberating it is to be a believer in Jesus Christ. When you read the Bible and understand the type of relationship God wants to have with you, you realize, "Wow, I've been lied to." It’s not about religion and rules; it’s not about any of that crap.</p>

  <p>“See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.” - Colossians 2:8</p>

  <p>You see, being a true Christian is not about a bad person becoming good; it’s actually about a dead person being made alive.</p>

  <p>“When you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our transgressions, having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.” - Colossians 2:13-14</p>
