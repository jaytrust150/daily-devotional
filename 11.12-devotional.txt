  <h1>Inner Beauty: More Than Meets the Eye</h1>

  <p>"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence." - Matthew 23:25 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>Amen! I saw a shocking video about a guy that is tattooed all over the outside of his body (face, head, neck, etc.) coming to the Lord! However, what's more shocking is that God forgives people who are all marked up inside. Jesus came to save the ugliest of the ugliest, and by that I mean internally wretched, nasty people (sinners—all of us). Just because someone is beautiful on the outside doesn't mean they're beautiful inside, and vice-versa. That was something that took me a long time to learn. TV, the internet, and movies always pick the best-looking people for the “good” roles, so you automatically believe all “good-looking” people are like that, and vice-versa. Don't fall for the hype; judge people by their character, not their looks (it could save you heartache).</p>

  <p>I now understand what shallow means: people who don't look inside a person but only at the outside (shallow), not going deep. There is a beauty that is internal that far surpasses even the outside.</p>

  <p>God bless this brother on the video I saw!</p>
