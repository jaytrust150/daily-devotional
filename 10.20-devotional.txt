  <h1>Discipline: A Sign of God's Love</h1>

  <p>"My son, do not reject the discipline of the Lord Or loathe His reproof, For whom the Lord loves He reproves, Even as a father corrects the son in whom he delights." - Proverbs 3:11-12</p>

  <p>We sometimes forget that discipline is a sign of love.</p>

  <p>I know that when I was heading down a bad path in my life, Jesus stepped in and changed my entire life around. Sometimes the hardest lessons in life are learned through tears.</p>
