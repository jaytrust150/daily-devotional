  <h1>Knowing God: Reflecting on His Character</h1>

  <p>"The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love." - 1 John 4:8</p>

  <p>“Worthy are You, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and because of Your will they existed, and were created.” - Revelation 4:11</p>

  <p>Have you ever thought about God? Like really imagined what His personality is like and who He is? (Especially now during Christmas, when we celebrate the birth of Christ.)</p>

  <p>The more you see Jesus, the more you get to see who God is, for Jesus is His "exact representation" (Hebrews 1:3). This is very comforting because, in Jesus, we see "perfection" being exhibited (shown) with absolutely no pride. Jesus came to serve people (Matthew 20:28), and although He was God, He humbled Himself and took the form of a servant (Philippians 2). Truly amazing, that God in the flesh was willing to wash feet (John 13), be spat in the face (Matthew 26:67), and yet He did not retaliate or make threats (1 Peter 2:23). Again, despite all the mistreatment and Jesus knowing what was in the heart of all men (John 2:24), He was still willing to die for us while we were sinners, not deserving it (Romans 5:7-8).</p>

  <p>Mind you, when He was on the cross paying the price for sins, people were insulting and disrespecting Him, yet He was still loving, saying, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do" (Luke 23:34). They say, "Actions speak louder than words," so when the Bible says "God is love" (1 John 4:8), it doesn't just say it, but as you can see, it actively demonstrates it by having an innocent Jesus going to the cross publicly for the whole world to see, to take the punishment we as sinners deserve, and justifying us (making us righteous) as a gift (Romans 3:24-25). Interestingly enough, God is never portrayed like this in any other religion. "Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends" (John 15:13).</p>

  <p>So you see, when a Christian says that God is perfect, all-loving and kind, and the most beautiful and awesome being, it is only by reading the Bible and seeing the life of Jesus that allows us to arrive at this conclusion. (This is one of many reasons why it's very important to read the Bible—to know God.) And even though it is true that the heavens declare His glory (Psalm 19:1) (examine the world from a scientific perspective) to see with what great care and brilliance God used to design the world, animals, humans (DNA), space, etc., it is His redeeming sacrificial love that has me awestruck the most!</p>

  <p>"Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things." - Philippians 4:8</p>

  <p>That being the case, I can safely say there is nothing better to dwell (think) on than God, who is all of the above and then some!</p>

  <p>So when you find yourself with bad thoughts or thinking negatively, STOP IT! Instead, focus on the person of Jesus and on what manner of love He has for us! Again, instead of negative thoughts, think about what an awesome God we have and the great love He has for us, and I'm sure your day and thoughts will get better, I promise!</p>
