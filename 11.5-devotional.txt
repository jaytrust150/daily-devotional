  <h1>A Thanksgiving Reflection: Gratitude and Eternal Feasting</h1>

  <p>“There is nothing better for a man than to eat and drink and tell himself that his labor is good. This also I have seen that it is from the hand of God.” - Ecclesiastes 2:24</p>

  <p>I'm super thankful for God, my family, friends, my job, and everything that I’ve been able to experience this year that has let me get closer to God. So with that, I would like to say Happy Thanksgiving ahead of time, and I hope you enjoy your meal and family!</p>

  <p>What’s the opposite of being thankful? Being unappreciative, but “regret” comes close. It’s not even accepting the gift and being able to be thankful. Most people going to “hell” at the end of their life demonstrate regret with “weeping and gnashing” of teeth, totally the opposite of being “thankful.” “Regret”...</p>

  <p>I’ll leave that there so we can be “thankful” to God that’s not our fate if you confess “Jesus is Lord!” or so that we repent before it's too late.</p>

  <p>“In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being thrown out. And they will come from east and west and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God.” - Luke 13:28-29</p>

  <p>As you eat your meal with your earthly family, always be “alert” and remember one day…</p>

  <p>“Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he comes; truly I say to you, that he will prepare himself to serve, and have them recline at the table, and he will come up and serve them.” - Luke 12:37</p>

  <p>Amen 🙏</p>
