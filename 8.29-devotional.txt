  <h1>Loving Your Enemies: A Mark of God's Children</h1>

  <p>“You have heard that it was said, ‘YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” - Matthew 5:43-48 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>God’s not mad at you. He actually is super proud and happy you even consider Him. If you ever have doubts whether you are pleasing to Him, just having the doubt shows you are His child, and that’s pleasing to Him.</p>
