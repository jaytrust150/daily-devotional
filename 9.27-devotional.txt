  <h1>Chosen by Grace: Rejoicing in God's Sovereign Election</h1>

  <p>“For this reason God will send upon them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false, in order that they all may be judged who did not believe the truth, but took pleasure in wickedness. But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth. It was for this He called you through our gospel, that you may gain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.” - 2 Thessalonians 2:11-14</p>

  <p>In the above verses, Paul (the writer of the book of Thessalonians) is speaking to the church at Thessalonica about the “end times.” He says many important things to us, the church (believers). Yet the one thing I would like to point out, that makes me want to give thanks, as Paul tells us to do (2 Thessalonians 2:13), is the fact that “God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation.” This is remarkable and very pleasing. To know that God Almighty has chosen us—not that we chose Him, but HE chose us! Remarkable! God has chosen us as a prized possession (1 Peter 2:9).</p>

  <p>Think about it. If what the Bible says is true, and the words of God have reached you and you have believed in Jesus, then you are blessed to be counted among the saved—those who will not perish in hell but with those who possess eternal life.</p>

  <p>“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.” - John 3:16</p>

  <p>Now, if you willingly choose not to believe, it's because God didn't choose you for salvation. I'm sorry. Although I'm not surprised, the Bible explains this. To be clear, though, you can always repent and turn to God; there is still time, so that you can be counted amongst the saved. If you choose not to, though, again, it's explained below.</p>

  <p>“But though He had performed so many signs before them, yet they were not believing in Him. This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke: ‘LORD, WHO HAS BELIEVED OUR REPORT? AND TO WHOM HAS THE ARM OF THE LORD BEEN REVEALED?’ For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again, ‘HE HAS BLINDED THEIR EYES AND HE HARDENED THEIR HEART, SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT SEE WITH THEIR EYES AND PERCEIVE WITH THEIR HEART, AND BE CONVERTED AND I HEAL THEM.’ These things Isaiah said because he saw His glory, and he spoke of Him. Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing Him, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue; for they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God.” - John 12:37-42</p>

  <p>Again, God makes this clearer in Romans 9 and explains why He has “blinded” and “hardened their hearts,” which I'll talk about soon (or you can go read it today). Mind you, if you find yourself a member of the family of God, saved by faith through grace, then rejoice and be thankful! If, however, you find yourself on the outside looking in, well, as I said before, there is still time, so I'll end this by quoting the words of our Lord Jesus found in Mark:</p>

  <p>“and saying, ‘The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.’” - Mark 1:15</p>
