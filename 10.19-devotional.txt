  <h1>Taking Every Thought Captive: The Foolishness of Atheism</h1>

  <p>"We are destroying speculations and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ." - 2 Corinthians 10:5 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>Someone reading my post from yesterday might wonder, "Jonathan, why would you call atheists stupid for not believing in God? That’s not nice." Well, I’m not trying to be nice; I’m being honest. The smartest man by IQ believes there is a God, and so does the guy who invented calculus and the laws of physics we still study today. I'm just bringing to light the truth.</p>

  <p>I mean, have you ever seen a painting that has no painter? Ever played a computer game that has no creator? Ever lived in a house that was built by nobody? Then realize how it’s even dumber to say that this world, science, mathematics, intelligence, DNA, the periodic table, etc., all exist without a creator/designer.</p>

  <p>“The fool says, 'There is no God.'” - Psalm 14:1</p>
