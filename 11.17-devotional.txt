  <h1>Christ in You, the Hope of Glory</h1>

  <p>"Of this church I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit, so that I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God, that is, the mystery which has been hidden from the past ages and generations, but has now been manifested to His saints, to whom God willed to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory." - Colossians 1:25-27 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>So what was Paul (who is speaking in the verse above) preaching to the church and the very first Christians? A lot of it I spoke about in my prior post, but in short, it says it above: "Christ in YOU, the hope of glory"!</p>
