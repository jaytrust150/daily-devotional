  <h1>The High Standard of Righteousness: Understanding the Gospel</h1>

  <p>“For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven.” - Jesus Christ (Matthew 5:20)</p>

  <p>If you call yourself a Christian but don’t know or believe that you have to be “perfect” to get into heaven, you haven’t understood the Gospel (good news).</p>

  <p>The above are the words of Jesus, and if you didn’t know, the scribes and Pharisees were the “elite” religious people of the day, and even what they did wasn’t good enough. They practically lived in the church and studied the Scriptures their entire lives, and that's still not good enough.</p>

  <p>What’s the point? Learn about the full message of the Gospel (good news)!</p>

  <p>“He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” - 2 Corinthians 5:21</p>
