  <h1>Predestined by God's Will</h1>

  <p>“One who corrects a scoffer gets dishonor for himself, and one who rebukes a wicked person gets insults for himself. Do not rebuke a scoffer, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise person and he will love you. Give instruction to a wise person and he will become still wiser; teach a righteous person and he will increase his insight.” - Proverbs 9:7-9</p>

  <p>“For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.” - 1 Corinthians 1:18</p>

  <p>“In Him we also have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things in accordance with the plan of His will.” - Ephesians 1:11</p>

  <p>Thank God He has “predestined” us “according to the purpose of Him who works all things in accordance with the plan of His will”! Amen.</p>
