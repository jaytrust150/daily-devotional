  <h1>Built Up by the Word: Growing in Godliness</h1>

  <p>"And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified." - Acts 20:32</p>

  <p>It's important to read God's Word because we grow spiritually by it. We are told it's the equivalent of giving milk to a newborn baby (1 Peter 2:2). The Word also builds us up. Think of it like bodybuilding, but for the spirit. If you thought working out physically was important and profitable, imagine how much MORE important it is to be built up in the spirit.</p>

  <p>"For bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come." - 1 Timothy 4:8</p>

  <p>You might be wondering, "But how do I know what part of the Bible to read? It's so big!" I'd suggest starting in John or any of the Gospels and don't worry too much if you are reading the right or wrong section.</p>

  <p>"All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness." - 2 Timothy 3:16</p>
