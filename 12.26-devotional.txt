  <h1>Eternity Breaks Into Time</h1>

  <p>"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life." - John 3:16</p>

  <p>"In this season, I think often of that extraordinary verse in Isaiah 9:6, 'For to us a child is born, to us a Son is given.' Let us be sure of what is being said here. The SON is not born; the Son eternally existed and is GIVEN. The CHILD is BORN and entered our time.</p>

  <p>He who dwells in the realm of eternity entered time. He understands our times. And so it is that eternity breaks into time to give us a glimpse of what always was and is and will be. God, in that divine moment, revealed Himself as He had never been revealed before, through His Son. That is what the Christmas message was about and is about." - Ravi Zacharias</p>
