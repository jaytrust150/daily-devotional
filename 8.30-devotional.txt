  <h1>Reigning with Christ: The Millennial Kingdom</h1>

  <p>Sharing my personal devotional from today. Dr. David Jeremiah, along with Pastor Bob Hoekstra's <i>Day by Day by Grace</i>, were devotionals I read every day, as well as Charles H. Spurgeon's <i>Morning and Evening</i> devotions. Here is a sample of one below from Dr. David Jeremiah. Also, a special shout-out to Dr. Erwin Lutzer, one of my favorite pastors while I was in college. I used to listen to <i>Running to Win</i> almost every day, and also Steve Brown from <i>Key Life</i>.</p> 

  <p>“Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years.” - Revelation 20:6</p>

  <p>The modern era has witnessed the arrival of only one new millennium—the one that began in the year 2000. The rarity of a new millennium reveals how long a thousand years truly is.</p>

  <p>When we speak of the biblical Millennium, we forget what a lengthy period it will be. A thousand years. And that term is not figurative. Based on the law of repetition in biblical interpretation, the author of Revelation meant a literal thousand years when he mentioned the “thousand years” five times in the space of six verses (Revelation 20:1-6). It will last more than 13 times the length of the average human life span of 75 years. But here is the exciting truth: We who have died in Christ—or are alive in Him when He returns—will “reign with Him a thousand years” (Revelation 20:6).</p>

  <p>Our eternal life with God will begin in the thousand-year reign of Christ on earth. The Millennium will be the prelude to our glorious eternity in the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21).</p>

  <p>“There is a land of pure delight, where saints immortal reign.” - Isaac Watts</p>
