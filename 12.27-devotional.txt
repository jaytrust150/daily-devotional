  <h1>Following Christ: For Love or For Gain?</h1>

  <p>"Jesus answered them and said, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were filled. Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you, for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal.'" - John 6:26-27</p>

  <p>‚ÄúHe who follows Christ for his bag is a Judas; they who follow for loaves and fish are children of the devil; but those who attend Him out of love to Himself are His own beloved ones.‚Äù - Charles Haddon Spurgeon</p>

  <p>From my morning devotional‚Ä¶ a pretty hard saying, so I guess the same question can be asked of you: Why do you follow Christ?</p>

  <p>I'd hope it's because of love for Him and not what you can get in return‚Ä¶ although it‚Äôs true:</p>

  <p>‚ÄúYou will make known to me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; In Your right hand there are pleasures forever.‚Äù - Psalm 16:11</p>

  <p>Anyhow, my prayer for today:</p>

  <p>Lord, give me a heart and faith that's pure, one based on love for You and Your person, not for what benefits can derive/come from our relationship. Let me truly fall fully in love with You, as close as it's possible for me to love You as much or more than You love me. Lord, let me also die for You (Galatians 2:20) as You died for me, so I can learn to live for You.</p>

  <p>In Jesus' name I pray,</p>

  <p>Amen üôè</p>
