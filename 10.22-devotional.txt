  <h1>Living for God's Glory: A Life with Purpose</h1>

  <p>"When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things." - 1 Corinthians 13:11</p>

  <p>If someone were to ask you, "What is your life about?" what would you answer?</p>

  <p>When I was young, I would say my life is about "playing and having fun..."</p>

  <p>Then I got a bit older, and I would say my life is about "making a lot of money to buy whatever I want..."</p>

  <p>Then I got a bit older, had kids, and my life then became about "being financially secure to provide for my family."</p>

  <p>The older I've become, I believe the wiser my response. Now, if you ask me again, I would still reply, "Take care of my family," like I did before, but now with an added emphasis. My life is about...</p>

  <p>"Bringing glory to God!"</p>

  <p>Part of that means being a great father and providing for my family, but there is more to it than that. It means being excellent in all things I do, knowing why I'm doing it—to bring glory to God.</p>

  <p>A few more verses below:</p>

  <p>"Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father." - Colossians 3:17</p>

  <p>"Whether, then, you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God." - 1 Corinthians 10:31</p>

  <p>“Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.” - Matthew 5:16</p>

  <p>It's interesting when you see people and what their lives are about.</p>

  <p>Are you living for the glory of God?</p>
