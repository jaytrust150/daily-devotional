  <h1>Fear Not: God's Promise of Presence and Strength</h1>

  <p>"Do not fear, for I am with you; Do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God. I will strengthen you, surely I will help you, Surely I will uphold you with My righteous right hand." - Isaiah 41:10</p>

  <p>We need not fear in times of trial. The Lord promises to be with us always (Matthew 28:20).</p>
