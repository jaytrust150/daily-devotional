  <h1>Defending the Gospel: The Example of Stephen (Part 2)</h1>

  <p>
    "Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me."- Mat 5:11

    "â€œBrothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,"- Acts 7:2

    In part 1 last time, I began speaking about how the gospel (good news) was something that God announce way back(Luke 24:44;1 Peter 1:10-12; 2 Tim 3:16-17) in Genesis to Abraham and even before that to Adam and Eve.
    The verse I began with today is a promise God gives you when you suffer for His sake (Phil 1:29) especially when preaching the gospel.

    The second verse is how Stephen defended himself when men lied and said that he was speaking against Moses and God when the early church was teaching about Jesus. The reason this is important is because in his defense you can see where Stephen begins to teach, he starts in Genesis, this where the early church began to teach..
    "The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham." God appeared to Abraham when he was still a pagan called Abram. (later changing his name to Abraham). God still comes to us while we are pagans(Heb 12:2) in fact every believer was at one point a non-believer, no one is born a christian, you must be born again...

    Anyhow the bible explains that Stephen's defense came because religious men got people to lie about him and say that he was speaking against Moses(the law).. When you preach the gospel, it sounds as if you are speaking against the law(Paul in Romans and also in Galatians defends himself to those accusations). Some people will even go as far as saying that you say its ok to sin when you preach the true gospel. To this I say don't feel bad because you are in good company... they accused Stephen of speaking against Moses and the law, and even said Paul encouraged others to go out and do evil so good could come from it(Rom 3:8). It's crazy to think, but yeah religious people went against Paul for preaching the truth (mind you he wrote the most books in the bible) So don't feel bad if they speak bad about you for preaching the truth that Paul also preached! I wrote this for myself as much as I did for you. It's hard to tell people that their religion will not save them. Only Jesus saves... and religious people hate you when you tell them that, because they do all they do to try to justify(make right) themselves before God.. the bible is quiet clear "justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified."- Gal 2:16) The bible can't explain it any clearer, but I'll try... if you are trying to go to heaven based on religion/works other then what Jesus did on the cross, you are, (pardon the bad word), "f%#ked."

    For those who can't guess the word or choose not to say it... I'll say it clearer, you are going to HELL if you think your good actions or good works can get you into heaven...
    ""And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved."- Gal 2:16

    I usually edit what I'm going to say before I say it and in the process I made this post to long... That being the case, I'll post tomorrow some of what I originally intended to post regarding Stephen so stay tuned! (Part 2 of 3 originally was suppose to be 2 of 2)
