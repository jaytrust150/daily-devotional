  <h1>Lifted Up: The Gift of Eternal Life</h1>

  <p>“Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in Him.” - John 3:14-15 (NIV)</p>

  <p>During Christmas, we celebrate the birth of God Almighty. We stand in awe of our Lord and how He was willing to be born in a manger for us. Thank You, Lord Jesus!</p>

  <p>Merry Christmas, everyone!</p>

  <p>I thank God for my friends and family on this special day on which we celebrate the birth of our Savior, Christ, who gave us the free gift of eternal life.</p>
