  <h1>Enemies of the Cross: Beware of False Teachers</h1>

  <p>“Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God’s sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.” - Romans 3:20</p>

  <p>“You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly.” - Romans 5:6</p>

  <p>Verses like these are the type religious people hate. You rarely find those who are in ministry and are religious using those when they preach. They somehow skip right over those verses. It’s sad, but when you hide the glory of God and His majesty in salvation for whatever religious reasons you have, you become an “enemy of the cross” (Philippians 3:18).</p>

  <p>Be careful with these false teachers/prophets in these churches (Matthew 24:24). They're slick; they almost got me! lol.</p>

  <p>I’d never call them out directly in public on blast because my prayer for them is:</p>

  <p>“Who are you to judge someone else’s servant? To their own master, servants stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.” - Romans 14:4</p>

  <p>That the Lord is able to make them stand... that He renews their minds and gives them a spirit of wisdom and revelation that reveals more of Him to them! So they can come to the knowledge of the truth! For You, Lord, are the Truth, the Way, and the Life! God bless us all, Lord, who try to proclaim Your name, whether for noble or ignoble reasons. Nonetheless, Your name and Word are proclaimed, and for that I rejoice. God bless all those in ministry, especially those who labor faithfully. Forgive us our shortcomings and help us do right. In Jesus’ name I pray, amen. 🙏</p>
