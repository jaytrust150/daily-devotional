  <h1>Protecting God's People: Rewards and Warnings</h1>

  <p>“They came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He began to question them, “What were you discussing on the way?” But they kept silent, for on the way they had discussed with one another which of them was the greatest. Sitting down, He called the twelve and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.” Taking a child, He set him before them, and taking him in His arms, He said to them, “Whoever receives one child like this in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me does not receive Me, but Him who sent Me.”
  (Dire Warnings)
  John said to Him, “Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us.” But Jesus said, “Do not hinder him, for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name, and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me. For he who is not against us is for us. For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of your name as followers of Christ, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward.
  “Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe to stumble, it would be better for him if, with a heavy millstone hung around his neck, he had been cast into the sea. If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life crippled, than, having your two hands, to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire, [where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.] If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame, than, having your two feet, to be cast into hell, where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched. If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell, where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.
  “For everyone will be salted with fire. Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.” - Mark 9:33-50</p>

  <p>In the above portion of Scripture from Mark 9, we hear the account of Jesus' disciples trying to stop other people who were essentially representing Him. Jesus says, "Don't you dare stop them! If you cause one of these little ones, who in my name is trying to perform a miracle, to stumble, it would be better for you to tie a big stone around your neck and be cast into the sea." In other words, Jesus loves His people. Sinning (doing wrong) against God's people is a terrible thing.</p>

  <p>He goes as far as to say in regards to sin that physically you are better off cutting off your hand or plucking out your eye if it means you won't sin. Likewise, don't mess with one of God's people, because hell is hot, and the worms eat you up. It's better to be good in the spiritual sense than in the physical sense when compared if it means not sinning—better to lose in the physical than in the spiritual.</p>

  <p>So in this account, we learn that God ultimately is the protector of His people. He rewards those who bless them and punishes those who hurt them (this was a special promise to Abraham)!</p>

  <p>“And I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.” - Genesis 12:3</p>

  <p>God is our great defender! So fear not if your attempt to help a brother or sister is foiled or doesn't work, because God knows your heart. After all, spiritual rewards are greater than physical rewards. As the saying goes, "It's the thought that counts," and trust me, God knows our hearts.</p>

  <p>“But the Lord said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for God does not see as man sees, since man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.” - 1 Samuel 16:7</p>
