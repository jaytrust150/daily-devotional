  <h1>Living for Eternity: What Matters Most?</h1>

  <p>"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?" - Matthew 16:26</p>

  <p>"The older I get, the more the nature of what is done for eternity comes into focus." - Unknown</p>

  <p>What are you living forâ€”eternal things or just temporary things?</p>

  <p>The approval of God is greater than earning all the world. Some people labor their entire lives accumulating wealth and fame but forget God, or worse, they trade their souls for riches.</p>

  <p>What or who are you living for? If your answer wasn't God, you're doing it wrong, and one day you WILL regret it.</p>
