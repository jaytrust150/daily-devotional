  <h1>Immanuel: God With Us</h1>

  <p>"Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly. But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.' Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 'BEHOLD, THE VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD AND SHALL BEAR A SON, AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL,' which translated means, 'GOD WITH US.'" - Matthew 1:18-23</p>

  <p>What a shock! Imagine being Joseph, and an angel telling you, "Look! Your wife is pregnant, and you haven't slept with her, but you shouldn't divorce her and kick her out as you plan. See, what's conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit!"</p>

  <p>I bet the first thing Joseph did after hearing what the angel told him, "being a righteous man," was go check the Scriptures! "Did a prophet hundreds of years ago really declare this?" I'm sure he was comforted to know that, yes indeed, the words of the Prophet Isaiah were true. The Holy Spirit (God's Spirit) did indeed cause Mary to become pregnant, and the child that would be born, Jesus, would be known as "God with us"!</p>
