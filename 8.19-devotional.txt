  <h1>Love is the Greatest: Past, Present, and Future</h1>

  <p>“If I could speak all the languages of earth and of angels, but didn’t love others, I would only be a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I had the gift of prophecy, and if I understood all of God’s secret plans and possessed all knowledge, and if I had such faith that I could move mountains, but didn’t love others, I would be nothing. If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body, I could boast about it; but if I didn’t love others, I would have gained nothing.” - 1 Corinthians 13:1-3</p>

  <p>“Now we see things imperfectly, like puzzling reflections in a mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity. All that I know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know everything completely, just as God now knows me completely. Three things will last forever—faith, hope, and love—and the greatest of these is love.” - 1 Corinthians 13:12-13</p>

  <p>How important is love? Well, at the end of it all, in the future, when we finally get to “see everything” and get to “know everything completely,” the Bible says love is the greatest. I want you to notice that the second verse quoted above is speaking about the future. I also want you to notice the first verse quoted above, found in the same chapter, is talking about the past. You can tell because it uses all the past-tense adjectives (could, would, had, etc.), explaining that without love, all the past is also meaningless—“nothing.”</p>

  <p>I mean, think about that, when comparing faith, hope, and love, some of the most wonderful things in the Bible, love is declared the greatest (1 Corinthians 13:13)! Think about that: we are saved by “faith” through grace in Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:8-9), we live in the “hope” of His return (Titus 2:13), yet to love God and be loved by Him (Ephesians 1:4, John 3:16) is the greatest thing that has ever happened to us, not only in the past, but now and forevermore! Amen! I love you, Lord Jesus; thank you for loving me (Ephesians 5:2) even before you made the world (Ephesians 1:4) (past), and for wanting to love me forever in eternity (future), and for loving and watching over me currently (present). You are love, Lord (1 John 4:8), and it’s so awesome! You have always loved us in the past, present, and future! Amen!</p>

  <p>I think this is why Paul, who wrote the most books in the Bible, in the next verse proceeding the last scripture quoted above, tells us to make love our highest goal! To pursue it, to make it our aim, to follow after it. The Greek term used in the original language is <i>diōkō</i>, and it’s translated with all those capitalized words I just mentioned.</p>

  <p>“Let love be your highest goal! But you should also desire the special abilities the Spirit gives—especially the ability to prophesy.” - 1 Corinthians 14:1 (NLT)</p>
