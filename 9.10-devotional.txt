  <h1>Serving the True Master: Choosing God Over Wealth</h1>

  <p>“No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth.” - Matthew 6:24</p>

  <p>So what prevents a person from knowing who the Lord is? From some of the scriptures I’ve been studying, I notice money is one of the greatest deceivers. What do I mean? Well, apparently idols are things that take the place of God in our lives, and some people spend their entire lives seeking wealth and lose out on true treasure. So why do I mention this?</p>

  <p>Well, honestly, every time I post, I want to write something life-changing, and nothing is more life-changing than to change one’s life purpose. Who do you seek to serve? As the scripture I began this post says…read it again.</p> 

  <p>“But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.” - 2 Corinthians 4:7</p>

  <p>So what’s this treasure that’s worth more than all the wealth this earth can offer? Read 2 Corinthians 4 for context!</p>

  <p>The point is, some of us waste our lives accumulating “wealth” and lose the real treasure. Scary to think of it.</p>

  <p>The Bible even wagers you the whole world and says even if you could get the whole world and everything in it, it’s still an L compared to the poorest Christian in the world who is indwelt by God’s Spirit. Imagine that: Elon Musk is to be pitied more than the poorest African or Chinese or American living in poverty because they have God’s Spirit. Now, if Elon Musk was also a Christian and used his wealth for the Lord, then yeah, he would be double blessed, I guess (still hope, even for the very, very rich).</p>

  <p>“For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?” - Matthew 16:26</p>
