  <h1>Pleasing the Lord: The Path to Peace and Righteousness</h1>

  <p>"When a manâ€™s ways are pleasing to the Lord, He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. Better is a little with righteousness Than great income with injustice. The mind of man plans his way, But the Lord directs his steps." - Proverbs 16:7-9</p>
