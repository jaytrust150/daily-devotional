  <h1>Chasing True Riches: A Warning Against Materialism</h1>

  <p>“Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.” - Hebrews 10:23 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>“Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” - Romans 8:1</p>

  <p>The following is not for you to doubt your salvation (that's what the devil tries to do), but more so for you to make sure you align your priorities (what's important) with what God considers important. "Stop chasing wealth—you're already rich! Chase God!" Anyway, here's a passage from James, chapter 5:</p>

  <p>“Come now, you rich, weep and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you. Your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth-eaten. Your gold and your silver have rusted; and their rust will be a witness against you and will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have stored up your treasure! Behold, the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields, which has been withheld by you, cries out; and the outcry of those who did the harvesting has reached the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. You have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of wanton pleasure; you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter. You have condemned and put to death the righteous; he does not resist you.</p>
  <p>Exhortation</p>
  <p>Therefore be patient, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. The farmer waits for the precious produce of the soil, being patient about it, until it gets the early and late rains. You too be patient; strengthen your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near. Do not complain, brethren, against one another, so that you yourselves may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing right at the door. As an example, brethren, of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. We count those blessed who endured. You have heard of the endurance of Job and have seen the outcome of the Lord’s dealings, that the Lord is full of compassion and merciful.” - James 5:1-11</p>

  <p>It's crazy! My friend Jim Rocco was telling me today about a friend he has from Africa who came to visit him. His description of what his friend saw here was shocking. Basically, to his friend, all Americans are rich (no one in his country even owns cars, and if you do, you are rich). That made me start to think: Am I one of those rich persons Jesus always talks about in His sermons? Or, more importantly, are YOU?</p>

  <p>It's a scary thought, but if you live in the United States of America, even our poor are "rich" by world standards.</p>

  <p>So how do you tell if you are poor or rich by the “world standards”?</p>

  <p>Easy. Do you make more than $2.15 a day? Then guess what? You are not poor but are rich in this world.</p>

  <p>Again, this isn't a message of condemnation but more a realization that we are truly rich (despite bills, etc.). Try to donate to the church and others who are carrying out the work of ministry, even if you can't engage. Sometimes we can't afford money, but hopefully, we can give time or service.</p>
