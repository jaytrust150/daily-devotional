  <h1>Guarding Your Heart and Mind: Discernment and Celebration</h1>

  <p>"Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." - Philippians 4:6-7</p>

  <p>Don't fall for the hype. Lies are easily conceived and so readily believed. If what you hear sounds too good to be true, there is a chance it might be. This is the case when meeting others in relationships, considering money ventures, and with other opportunities that arise. It takes time and wisdom to get to know someone. You can't believe a liar who tells you he is honest or a cheater who tells you he plays fair.</p>

  <p>“When God forgives us, we are forgiven. When God cleanses us, we are made clean. That is a cause for great celebration.” —R.C. Sproul</p>
