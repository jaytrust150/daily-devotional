  <h1>Stephen's Legacy: A Witness That Changed the World (Part 3)</h1>

  <p>"But they could not stand up against the wisdom the Spirit gave him as he spoke. Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, “We have heard Stephen speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.” - Acts 6:10</p>

  <p>“Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran." - Acts 7:2</p>

  <p>Recently we began speaking about Stephen, popularly known as the first Christian martyr (the Greek word martyr means "witness"), so we understand the word to mean those who died as a witness for Christ, and Stephen was the first as recorded by the Bible. His testimony is found in Acts 6-8. We learned that some religious people were accusing Stephen of speaking against Moses and God... but Stephen, in "the wisdom the Spirit gave him," responded by going through Genesis and the promises God gave that are found there pointing to Christ...</p>

  <p>You might wrongly think the gospel (good news) began in the New Testament when Jesus was born... the Bible clearly teaches this is NOT the case. God's plan for salvation began in eternity past (Revelation 13:8). From the very start of the Bible, God is setting His plan of salvation in motion... right at the start in Genesis, God promises Eve that a man who was to be a descendant of hers would be born (Genesis 3:15) and take care of what the Serpent (Revelation 20:2) did in the Garden. He later reaffirmed that oath to Abraham. This is how Stephen started his defense—he begins by starting with Abraham and then continues through all of Genesis, then goes into Exodus (Moses) and even gets to the book of Samuel (David)... At the very end, he even says that they (his accusers) killed Jesus just like their ancestors killed the prophets who proclaimed the coming of Jesus! (Acts 7:51-53)</p>

  <p>You can pretty much guess what happens next... He became the first Christian Martyr and was stoned to death....</p>

  <p>"And dragged him out of the city. Then they started throwing stones at him. The men who had brought charges against him put their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul." - Acts 7:58</p>

  <p>The end? No wait, there’s more… his death was not in vain... Stephen triumphantly witnessed to perhaps the greatest Christian missionary ever! He witnessed to PAUL (Paul at the time was still being referred to as Saul. God has a funny way of changing people, even their names, kind of like Abram to Abraham... Saul to Paul... maybe you, too, will get a new name one day (Revelation 2:17)).</p>

  <p>Anyhow, it’s encouraging to see that even though Stephen lost his life because he shared his faith, (and perhaps you, too, might take a loss because of sharing your faith... don’t worry about what you might lose even if, like Stephen, it costs you your life) because by your witness God could gain a Paul. In case you don't know much about Paul, know this—he was our Apostle (Galatians 2:8)! (He was called the apostle of the gentiles, meaning non-Jewish folks)! Paul wrote down the oracles of God. He introduced us (Gentiles) to the GOSPEL!! The people who were once called not the people of God. He spread the good news that God died to save ALL MEN! I mean, I can't even begin to express how important Paul was to the Church (I don't mean a religious organization, I'm using the word the way the Bible uses it). Paul was used by God to reveal the mysteries of Christ and God Himself... I don’t know about you, but I will take an L any day if it means advancing God’s kingdom and being able to witness to a Paul! Stephen truly was blessed (Matthew 5:11).</p>

  <p>“Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran," - Acts 7:2</p>

  <p>This is where I will end this post, where Stephen began. The story of God finding an unbeliever... and the rest is, how they say, History (Read about it in Acts 7!)... (Part 3 of 3)</p>
