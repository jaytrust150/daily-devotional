<h1>God Sees Your Heart</h1>

<p>"By pouring this perfume on Me, she has prepared My body for burial. Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.” - Matthew 26:12-13</p>

<p>The above verses come from the story of a woman who poured an EXPENSIVE perfume on Jesus... the disciples, however, frowned upon her and complained that she wasted the expensive perfume instead of selling it to give the money to the poor (Matthew 26:7-12). Read the story...</p>

<p>Next time you find yourself doing something for Jesus and people think what you are doing is pointless or even wrong... "DON'T PANIC!" Remember the act of devotion in the story above was even frowned upon by the disciples, yet we know that what she did was actually pleasing to Jesus. He even commends (praises) her for it! Jesus said, "wherever the gospel is preached in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her."</p>

<p>I figure since I've been preaching the gospel, it's only right to listen to Jesus and tell the story "in memory of her"!</p>

<p>Let that serve as a warning to us, that if even the disciples didn't understand her act of love and devotion to Jesus, neither will the world understand our love and devotion to Him. They don't believe in Him, so of course, our actions seem strange or even foolish to them. God is aware of what the world thinks...</p>

<p>"For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God." - 1 Corinthians 1:18</p>

<p>So again, DON'T PANIC!</p>

<p>The point is that God is aware of your circumstances (and the people around you) and He sees your heart too, so even if the world doesn't get it... so what? God will and does!</p>

<p>So when the world deems what you do as little or insignificant, remember God does NOT (it's not about the outcome, it's about your intention, one plants, one waters, but only God gives the growth - 1 Corinthians 3:7).</p>

<p>Jesus told another story that I think illustrates this...</p>

<p>"And He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury. And He saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins. And He said, “Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them; for they all out of their surplus put into the offering; but she out of her poverty put in all that she had to live on.” - Luke 21:1-4</p>

<p>We never did get to hear what happened to the poor widow or, for that matter, where they ended up spending the "two small copper coins" she gave (obviously that's not the point of the story). But one thing we do know is that her testimony still lives on, and only God knows how many people she inspired to give more for the spread of His gospel because of her giving.</p>

<p>Therefore, I want to encourage you and say that the same could be said of your effort, time, talents, money, etc. God notices. So whether the money you give to the church is spent correctly (that's on them, don't worry) or your time/effort spreading the gospel or helping the needy ends in success (don't worry). What matters is that you proved faithful and gave of yourself to God. So although we haven't heard yet what happened to the poor widow, we need only remember that God is faithful and would never forget her or us (Hebrews 6:10). Amen!</p>
