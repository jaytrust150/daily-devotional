  <h1>Knowing You Have Eternal Life: God's Assurance for Believers</h1>

  <p>“These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.” - 1 John 5:13</p>

  <p>One thing the Bible makes clear is that God wants us to know that we who believe in the name of the Son of God have eternal life.</p>

  <p>“Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” - Romans 5:7-8</p>
