  <h1>One in Christ: Salvation for All Who Believe</h1>

  <p>“If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.” - 1 Peter 4:11 (KJV)</p>

  <p>“Brethren, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God for them is for salvation.” - Romans 10:1</p>

  <p>What is Paul (the person who wrote Romans, Scripture above) talking about?</p>

  <p>In context, he is talking about the Jewish people (his brethren—Jesus was Jewish too, in case you didn't know), how he wants them all to be saved, and he explains how they can be. How does this apply to us, who are not Jewish, after all, the Messiah is for the Jewish people, He was prophesied to come, etc.? Well, that's the part of the chapter I love the most—how the Jewish people are saved and everyone else (Muslim, Christian, atheist, whoever) is one and the same.</p>

  <p>Read the whole chapter!!!</p>

  <p>Lil Snippet/Spoiler Alert!</p>

  <p>“that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation.” - Romans 10:9-10</p>
