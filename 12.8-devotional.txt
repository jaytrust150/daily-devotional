  <h1>Overcoming the Devil: The Victory of the Lamb</h1>

  <p>“And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.” - Revelation 12:6-9</p>

  <p>“A thousand two hundred and threescore”, 1,260 days, 3.5 years… (This is a significant number that shows up in Revelation often when describing time periods. Anyhow, that’s a side note.)</p>

  <p>There are a lot of takeaways from this passage. For one, the woman is Israel/Jewish (God’s people) (context clues explain why; for example, the Messiah, Jesus Christ—son of woman—came from Israel, but this is not my focus). However, who the dragon is is clear: it is the devil, the serpent of old from Genesis 3 (who deceived Adam and Eve). This shows the timeline after he was cast out of heaven to earth (he currently rules this earth—the devil is called the god of this earth as described in 2 Corinthians 4:4, with a little "g." The real God is big "G").</p>

  <p>Anyhow, what’s the point?</p>

  <p>“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.” - Ephesians 6:12</p>

  <p>Never fight in the flesh.</p>

  <p>How do we beat (overcome) the devil? The next few verses following what I posted from Revelation 12 above tell us:</p>

  <p>“And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they did not love their life even when faced with death. For this reason, rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you with great wrath, knowing that he has only a short time.” - Revelation 12:11-12</p>

  <p>Mind you, it’s written in the past tense because God, who exists outside of time, knowing the end from the beginning (He orders it), declares it, and we win through Jesus Christ, the Messiah of the world! Jews and Gentiles.</p>
