  <h1>Equipped for Life and Godliness</h1>

  <p>"His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness." - 2 Peter 1:3</p>

  <p>As a Christian, you aren't justified (saved) by the way you live, but that doesn't mean a Christian is to sin. By abiding in Christ, the total opposite actually occursâ€”we are enabled to live lives pleasing to the Lord. This, however, takes time and growth.</p>
