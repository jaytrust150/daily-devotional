  <h1>Resisting Sin's Deceitfulness</h1>

  <p>"But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called Today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin's deceitfulness." - Hebrews 3:13</p>

  <p>Being deceived into believing that sinning is the best thing in the world, we foolishly never see the effects of sin, just the fleeting pleasure it brings in the moment.</p>

  <p>"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." - Romans 6:23</p>
