  <h1>Serving Christ by Serving Others</h1>

  <p>“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’” - Matthew 25:40</p>

  <p>The above is Jesus speaking. In another section of Scripture, we read:</p>

  <p>“And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not lose their reward.” - Matthew 10:42 (NIV)</p>

  <p>Throughout Scripture (the conversion of Saul to Paul, for example, in the book of Acts, chapter 9), we learn that when the Bible says that we are the body of Christ, God takes it literally. Whatever happens to you (the body), Christ, who is the head, also feels (1 Corinthians 12).</p>

  <p>If you love God, you can demonstrate it with actions as you love and support the body (other believers), knowing that it is Christ whom you are truly serving, as the Scriptures teach us.</p>

  <p>“For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.” - Ephesians 2:10 (NLT)</p>
