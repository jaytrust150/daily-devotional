  <h1>The Enduring Word in a Changing World</h1>

  <p>"For you have been born again not of seed which is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and enduring word of God. For, 'ALL FLESH IS LIKE GRASS, AND ALL ITS GLORY LIKE THE FLOWER OF GRASS. THE GRASS WITHERS, AND THE FLOWER FALLS OFF, BUT THE WORD OF THE LORD ENDURES FOREVER.' And this is the word which was preached to you." - 1 Peter 1:23-25</p>

  <p>As this year comes to an end, I reflect on past days and look forward to future days, knowing that time marches forward, not backward. It might sound silly, but if you think about it, 100 years from now, we won't be here. But here's a happy thought: we will be with the Lord.</p>

  <p>Many have challenged the Bible's authority and questioned its authenticity, but it has remained unscathed. The word of the Lord endures forever! The Bible has passed the test of time. The words it contains are Truth and Life. Never has a book existed that took over 2000 years to write, with 40 different authors in 3 different languages, painting a picture and message that only God could write. Some call it God's love letter to humanity, and they are right because there's no other way the story could have been told.</p>

  <p>“You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me; and you are unwilling to come to Me so that you may have life.” - Jesus Christ (John 5:39-40)</p>

  <p>Happy New Year!</p>
