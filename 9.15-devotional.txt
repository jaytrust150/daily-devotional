  <h1>A Time for Everything: Trusting God's Plan in Difficult Times</h1>

  <p>“Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Your book were all written The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them.” - Psalm 139:16</p>

  <p>The Bible is quite clear when it comes to God's sovereignty (rule/control) regarding our lives. The Bible goes as far as making the claim that even before we were born, God ordained, already had a plan for our lives. This is very comforting indeed. “How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! (Psalm 139:17).” Below is a section of Scripture I like to lean on when things aren't going as I'd hoped or planned for.</p>

  <p>“There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens: a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to uproot, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build, a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance, a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, a time to search and a time to give up, a time to keep and a time to throw away, a time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak, a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace. What do workers gain from their toil? I have seen the burden God has laid on the human race. He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end. I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live.” - Ecclesiastes 3:1-12</p>

  <p>Going through a difficulty or hard times? Well, I got good news for you: there is a time for everything. God knows what you are going through, even before you have gone through it (Psalm 139:16). See, God never promised us a life that was stress- and worry-free, but he does command and tell us, “Do not worry about tomorrow (Matthew 6:24)” and again, “Be anxious for nothing (Philippians 4:6).” As hard as it might seem, if we faithfully trust God and pray for Him to act on our behalf, as we wait it out, things will get better. Don't believe me? Just look at Scripture. Take Job, Daniel, or even Joseph from the Old Testament. I'm sure they never imagined what God had planned for them, but they first had to go through the fire (difficult times) before things turned out great for them. Little did they know what a marvelous plan God had for their lives. Even our Lord had to go through it before “he sat down at the right hand of the throne of God (Hebrews 12:1-3).”</p>

  <p>Remember, God has a plan for your life that includes bad moments as well as good moments. “There is a time for everything.” Yet we should know that God works all things for good (even the bad) (Romans 8:28), and based on the lives of the Old Testament saints Job, Daniel, and Joseph, looking how their lives turned out after losing loved ones, being thrown into the lion's den, being imprisoned, falsely accused, etc. Referring to Job, we are told, “The LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; (Job 42:12).” When speaking about the evil Joseph's brothers did to him, which directly led to Joseph ascending to the throne, being second in power only to Pharaoh: “As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, to preserve many people alive. (Genesis 50:20),” etc. God worked it all out for their good. At the end of the day, we need not worry about these hardships we must endure, knowing that although at the time things are hard, things will get better; they always have. Just look back upon your life and see how God has been faithful in the past and be assured He will be just as faithful in the future.</p>

  <p>As a young Christian, I've grown so much by trusting and turning to Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith,
