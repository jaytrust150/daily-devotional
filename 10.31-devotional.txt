  <h1>A Marriage Made in Heaven: God's Love for His Church</h1>

  <p>"Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless." - Ephesians 5:25-28</p>

  <p>God uses many of the things He created to help us better understand our relationship with Him. In Ephesians, we see our relationship to God being described as a marriage. Marriage is perhaps the most intimate relationship that could possibly exist. We learn that God gave Himself up for us out of love so He could prepare us for when we will be united forever.</p>
