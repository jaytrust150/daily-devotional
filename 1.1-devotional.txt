  <h1>New Year, New Beginnings</h1>

  <p>
    "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, [he is] a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come." - 2 Corinthians 5:17 NASB95
  </p>

  <p>
    Starting the new year with a splash (we literally went swimming today)!! God bless everyone as we start the new year!
  </p>

  <p>
    A fresh beginning and new start, kind of like when we first received Christ and similar to the start of a new day for us.

    "The LORD'S lovingkindnesses indeed never cease, For His compassions never fail. 23 [They] are new every morning; Great is Your faithfulness." - Lamentations 3:22-23 NASB95
  </p>

  <p>
    New Year! Perfect time to start your new goal, whatever it might be, or make that change you've been wanting to for the longest!
  </p>

  <p>
    New Year! Fresh Start! New Beginnings!
