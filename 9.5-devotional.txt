  <h1>The Certainty of Eternal Life: Born of the Spirit</h1>

  <p>“And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.” - 1 John 5:11-13</p>

  <p>If there is one thing the Bible tries to make clear, it’s that God has given us eternal life in His Son. God doesn't want to leave us unsure of our standing with Him; perfect love casts out all fear.</p>

  <p>To quote D.L. Moody:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Some day you will read in the papers, ‘D. L. Moody of East Northfield is dead.’ Don't you believe a word of it!</p>
    <p>At that moment I shall be more alive than I am now; I shall have gone up higher, that is all, out of this old clay tenement into a house that is immortal—a body that death cannot touch, that sin cannot taint; a body fashioned like unto His glorious body.</p>
    <p>I was born of the flesh in 1837. I was born of the Spirit in 1856. That which is born of the flesh may die. That which is born of the Spirit will live forever.”</p>
    <p>—Dwight Lyman Moody (1837-1899)</p>
