  <h1>Born Again: The Necessity of Spiritual Rebirth</h1>

  <p>Whenever the Bible uses repetition, it's to highlight something important. Can you notice what Jesus repeated twice between John 3:1-7 below?</p>

  <p>"Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; this man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, 'Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher; for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.' Jesus answered and said to him, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.'" - John 3:1-3</p>

  <p>Are you born again? No, it's NOT a religion I'm talking about; it's a state of being—being born again. All children of God are born again, not through a physical birth, as Jesus would proceed to explain to Nicodemus, but a spiritual birth! So whether you attend a Catholic, Protestant, Baptist, Pentecostal, non-denominational, or whatever you call your local church, you MUST be BORN-AGAIN! Anyhow, don't take my word for it. Let's see what Jesus had to say in the rest of the story found in John 3, as quoted below.</p>

  <p>"Nicodemus said to Him, 'How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?' Jesus answered, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not be amazed that I said to you, 'You must be born again.' " - John 3:4-7</p>

  <p>Verse 6 stands out from the above passage:</p>

  <p>"Flesh is born of flesh, but spirit is born of the Spirit." - John 3:6</p>

  <p>By being "born of the Spirit" (the Spirit, uppercase, refers to God), we are able to start to have a relationship with God; He becomes our Father. In case you aren't born again, all it takes is belief (you will have a chance to prove your faith eventually, trust...).</p>

  <p>"so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life." - John 3:15</p>

  <p>It's crucial to be born again because it's how we are able to worship the Father, as Jesus tells us in the next chapter, and also because being born in the Spirit is the start (birth) of our spiritual walk as children of God—babes in Christ, as Paul would say (1 Corinthians 3:1; 1 Peter 2:2).</p>

  <p>"But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for such people the Father seeks to be His worshipers. God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.” - John 4:23-24</p>
