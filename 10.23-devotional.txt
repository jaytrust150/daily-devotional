  <h1>Teaching and Living the Word: The Importance of Integrity</h1>

  <p>"Let not many of you become teachers, my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment." - James 3:1</p>

  <p>Nothing is uglier than a person who claims to teach God's Word but doesn't live up to what they preach. It's called hypocrisy. Jesus hated fake religious people who do things for show, but when it comes time to walk the walk, they are found to be phony. Be honorable in all your ways and glorify God by your lifeâ€”not by what you say or what you post, but by how you live.</p>

  <p>"You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that one shall not steal, do you steal?" - Romans 2:21</p>
