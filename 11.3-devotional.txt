  <h1>The Pearl of Great Price: Exchanging All for God</h1>

  <p>"A man who hardens his neck after much reproof will suddenly be broken beyond remedy." - Proverbs 29:1 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>"When the righteous increase, the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule, the people groan." - Proverbs 29:2 (ESV)</p>

  <p>“For what does it benefit a person to gain the whole world, and forfeit his soul?” - Matthew 16:26</p>

  <p>Again, even if you had the entire world and possessed it all but didn’t have Jesus, it would still be an L (a loss).</p>

  <p>Once you start to see the true value of who God is, you would exchange it all for Him instead of chasing after the “wind.” You would realize the vanity of it all without having God. I feel bad for those of you who don’t know God intimately, and instead of getting to know Him, you chase after meaningless things that include getting rich, etc.</p>

  <p>“The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.” - Matthew 13:44</p>

  <p>Once you understand who God is, you start to understand these parables a bit better—why people give it all for God.</p>

  <p>“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.” - Matthew 13:45-46</p>
