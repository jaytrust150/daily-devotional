  <h1>Transformed by Beholding: Reflecting the Glory of the Lord</h1>

  <p>"But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit." - 2 Corinthians 3:18</p>

  <p>The less we focus on ourselves and behold our Lord, the more we are transformed. The Christian life isn't about following rules but following Christ!</p>

  <p>"For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus." - Philippians 1:6</p>
