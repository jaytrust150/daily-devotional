  <h1>Good News of Great Joy: Immanuel, God With Us (Part 3)</h1>

  <p>“The angel said to him, 'I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.'” - Luke 1:19</p>

  <p>Tired of all the “fake” news? Here's some “real” good news you might appreciate (hint: it's the reason for the season)...</p>

  <p>“Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call His name Immanuel.” - Isaiah 7:14</p>

  <p>Mind you, this news was delivered and recorded in the Bible several hundred years before the birth of Christ and before Gabriel announced and confirmed it! (Modern science proves Isaiah's account in the Old Testament was written several hundred years prior to Gabriel's confirmation of the "good news"—through carbon dating and archaeology!)</p>

  <p>This also brings me back to the devotional I started a few weeks ago that ended with the question below (check the past two posts):</p>

  <p>“Why will Jesus be bestowed such great honor and glory that every knee will bow before Him?”</p>

  <p>Just take a look at Scripture for an answer to that question:</p>

  <p>“Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death— even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.” - Philippians 2:6-11</p>

  <p>Jesus is "in very nature God." He was to be born of a virgin, and His name, Immanuel, literally means "God with us" (Matthew 1:23).</p>

  <p>Jesus is God with us! God became a man—to be more accurate, He became a baby boy—and that's why the world celebrates Christmas! A very Merry Christmas indeed!</p>

  <p>God came to save us and "made himself nothing." "He humbled himself," "being found in appearance as a man," "became obedient to death—even death on a cross."</p>

  <p>It's glorious what I'm talking about! (I could write non-stop about this, but this post is already too long.) It's so glorious that I don't even know how to talk about it. God Almighty, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, the person who created everything that has ever and will ever exist (math, science, DNA, sex, food, everything you enjoy/love), decided to come into our world as a baby. WHY? WHY? WHY? Why would God, the Most High, humble Himself to the point of dying on a cross? You all have seen the passion; you have heard the stories. Why would Jesus subject Himself to such abasement?</p>

  <p>LOVE (John 3:16)</p>

  <p>God has a great PURPOSE. The Bible calls it a mystery (Colossians 1:26) that began in Genesis, was accomplished on the cross, and will be finished in Revelation (Christ will have His bride - Ephesians 5). More about this next time, but here's a verse showing you that you need not worry, just trust God. I emphasized the word PURPOSE on purpose by writing it in uppercase because, God permitting, that's where I'm heading next, to speak about God's PURPOSE in salvation.</p>

  <p>“And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren; and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things? Who will bring a charge against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies; who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us. Who will separate us from the love of Christ?” - Romans 8:28-34</p>

  <p>The answer should be obvious... No one... (3 of 3)</p>
