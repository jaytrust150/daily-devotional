  <h1>The Kindness of God Leads to Repentance</h1>

  <p>“I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.” - Luke 5:32</p>

  <p>The above is Jesus speaking in the Gospel of Luke. I always want to write/talk about the Lord and who He is. I often refer to the scripture in Luke 19:40 as an excuse.</p>

  <p>“I tell you,” He answered, “if they remain silent, the very stones will cry out.” - Luke 19:40</p>

  <p>I feel that way sometimes; I can’t resist but speak of Him. Why?</p>

  <p>I think the above Scripture I started with explains it best; it’s found in that one word: repentance.</p>

  <p>Before I talk about “repentance,” let’s see why people even repent to begin with, according to the Bible.</p>

  <p>“Or do you think lightly of the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?” - Romans 2:4</p>

  <p>“The riches of His kindness.” The word “kindness” is the Greek word, <i>chrēstotēs</i>. It can also be translated as goodness. When we share the Gospel, we are speaking about the “kindness” of God in order to lead men to repentance. Repentance is a change of mind that leads one to turn to God, stemming from a realization of who God is in light of who we are (wretched sinners). It’s the “kindness” (goodness) of God that leads men to repentance (to turn to Him).</p>

  <p>Who God is leads me to want to repent and, out of necessity (I can’t help it), follow Him. I can’t help but want to forsake my old ways and those things that bring God displeasure (sin). That’s why you usually hear the word “repentance” and “sin” together. We repent of our sins (doing bad).</p>

  <p>It’s a natural (supernatural) thing that leads men and women to repent. The Christian is described as being born-again, a new creation, and rightly so. Prior to being born again, we might not have cared about whether we sinned, yet after being born again, we now find ourselves struggling with sin; we find in us a new nature. The Bible says we are now partakers of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4) as opposed to the sinful nature we were born with. Paul describes this new struggle the born-again Christian faces in the book of Romans 6-8 (that’s not the point of this writing, so I won’t go into it yet).</p>

  <p>Anyhow, if you haven’t repented yet and feel a desire to repent and turn to God, go for it. If you have no desire to repent, maybe you should get a taste of Him; read your Bible and get to know Him better.</p>

  <p>“O taste and see that the Lord is good; How blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!” - Psalm 34:8</p>
