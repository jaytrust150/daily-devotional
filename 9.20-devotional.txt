  <h1>Loved by Love: Knowing God Through Love</h1>

  <p>“Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love.” - 1 John 4:7-13</p>

  <p>The term "beloved" means to be loved. We are addressed as loved. We are loved by God, who is love. This chapter of the Bible is amazing. I'd be willing to bet that nowhere else in the Bible is the word "love" used as much as it is in this chapter. If you thought love made you do crazy things, imagine God and what His love for us makes Him do for us! The entire Bible is a love story.</p>
