  <h1>Testing the Spirits: The Enduring Word of God</h1>

  <p>"The grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God stands forever." - Isaiah 40:8</p>

  <p>If the Bible is the word of God, and what it claims about itself is true, then we can rest assured that any other source that contradicts it cannot originate from God. Now, why do I bother making this statement? Well, because we are warned in Scripture:</p>

  <p>"Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world." - 1 John 4:1</p>

  <p>So how do you test if someone is speaking on behalf of God? Well, one test is what they have to say about Jesus, as the next verse tells us. Do they claim Jesus came from God? Does what they say line up with what the Bible has to say? Does the prophet proclaim Jesus as God in the flesh, as the rest of Scripture does? Does the prophet affirm God's Word regarding the faith handed once for all to the saints (Jude 1)? If you answered no to any of the above, then I can safely say you aren't following the God of the Bibleâ€”fact.</p>
