  <h1>Faith in God: Believing the Creator</h1>

  <p>"And Jesus answered and said to them, 'Have faith in God.'" - Mark 11:22</p>

  <p>To those who might have heard the word "faith" tossed around and probably weren't sure what it means, a simple way to look at it is to take God at His word. It's believing in Him who created the heavens and the earth and everything else in between.</p>
