  <h1>Eternal Life in Christ: The Distinctive Message of Christianity</h1>

  <p>"And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life." - 1 John 5:11</p>

  <p>When we as Christians (believers in Christ) proclaim that eternal life is in Christ and feel compelled to share our faith with the world, it's not because we don't appreciate the moral teachings found in other religions. Many times, we agree on several moral issues. The main difference is what we proclaim: that man is fallen and that rules and regulations aren't enough to change a man internally. In fact, it was the knowledge of good and evil that got man into this (Genesis 2:17). It takes man to be born again, to eat from the tree of life (Genesis 3:22; Revelation 2:7), symbolic of Christ.</p>

  <p>“And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved.” - Acts 4:12</p>
