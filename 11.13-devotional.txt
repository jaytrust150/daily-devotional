  <h1>Born of the Spirit: A New Heart and a New Spirit</h1>

  <p>"The Scriptures tell us, 'The first man, Adam, became a living person.' But the last Adam—that is, Christ—is a life-giving Spirit." - 1 Corinthians 15:45 (NLT)</p>

  <p>"For no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God." - 2 Peter 1:21</p>

  <p>"The Bible explains the Bible," the old faithful preacher would say.</p>

  <p>Being born of the Spirit of God enables us to begin our Christian walk and allows the new believer the ability to worship the Father (John 4:23-24). There's this whole process explained in the Old Testament that centers on the blood sacrifice and God cleansing His people (the reason you don't lose your salvation is not because of what you did that saved you, but it's what God did). It's what began on the cross through Christ's death, burial, and resurrection—it's what enables the believer to be born again of the Spirit. This was a promise God made in the Old Testament and is fulfilling in Christ.</p>

  <p>"Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances." - Ezekiel 36:26-27</p>

  <p>“For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, 'Abba! Father!' The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God.” - Romans 8:14-16</p>
