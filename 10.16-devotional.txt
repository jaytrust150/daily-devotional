  <h1>The Way, the Truth, and the Life: Finding the Path to Salvation</h1>

  <p>"so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life." - John 3:15</p>

  <p>“Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also. And you know the way where I am going.” Thomas said to Him, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, how do we know the way?” Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me." - John 14:1-6</p>

  <p>“Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it." - Matthew 7:13-14</p>

  <p>In life, there are many paths one can take, and like all paths, eventually you arrive at a destination. Jesus refers to this in the above sections of Scripture I've quoted and below as well, yet He is speaking in a spiritual sense. The question stands: What path are you taking? Are you on the path that “leads to destruction,” or are you on the path that “leads to life”? If you didn't notice, notice how Jesus refers to not only being the way that leads to life but actually being that very life. He promises in another section of Scripture below to also be the “door” and promises that if anyone enters through Him, “he will be saved.” Are you saved?</p>

  <p>"So Jesus said to them again, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. All who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them. I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly. I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep. I am the good shepherd, and I know My own and My own know Me, even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep. I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice; and they will become one flock with one shepherd. For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I may take it again. No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father.'" - John 10:7-18</p>
