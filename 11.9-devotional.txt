  <h1>Transformed by Grace: A Living Sacrifice</h1>

  <p>"Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect." - Romans 12:1-2</p>

  <p>To understand why the "therefore" is there, you need to read the prior chapter, which touches upon the concept of grace in relation to Israel, who in times past tried to attain righteousness through the law (worksâ€”living a certain lifestyle, as many other religions do). According to the Bible, it is impossible for normal man, born into sinful humanity, to obtain righteousness in this way. The law only makes us aware of sin and does nothing to change a man internally. This is where grace comes in. Through God's Spirit, a believer in Christ is truly transformed.</p>
