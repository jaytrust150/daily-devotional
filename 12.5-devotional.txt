  <h1>Blessed to Be a Blessing: The Promise to Abraham</h1>

  <p>"Now the Lord said to Abram, 'Go forth from your country, And from your relatives And from your father's house, To the land which I will show you; And I will make you a great nation, And I will bless you, And make your name great; And so you shall be a blessing; And I will bless those who bless you, And the one who curses you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.'" - Genesis 12:1-3 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>The above is a promise from our Lord to Abram before he changed his name to Abraham. The main focus of the above, which we celebrate now at Christmas time, is that last part of that verse: “and in you all the families of the earth will be blessed!”</p>

  <p>God did not lie! Just look how the first Gospel starts:</p>

  <p>"The record of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham: Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers." - Matthew 1:1-2 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>There is great spiritual significance in this, for Abraham had two sons, and so did Isaac, but it was the child of promise who God elected/chose.</p>

  <p>"And you brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise." - Galatians 4:28 (NASB95)</p>
