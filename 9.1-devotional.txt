  <h1>The Father's Will: Eternal Life and Resurrection</h1>

  <p>“This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all that He has given Me I lose nothing, but raise it up on the last day. For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.” - John 6:39-40</p>

  <p>Amen, that the Father's will is that we who believe in the Son have eternal life and will be raised up on the last day.</p>
