  <h1>Dwelling on the Positive: A Prescription for Peace</h1>

  <p>A couple of days ago, I wrote about how Paul tells us to rejoice in the Lord and be thankful instead of being anxious or worried. He encourages us to pray to God instead of stressing over problems (Philippians 4:4-7).</p>

  <p>"Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things." - Philippians 4:8</p>

  <p>In this verse, Paul tells us what should occupy our thoughts (in contrast to worries). He says that whatever is true, honorable, right, pure, lovely, good, excellent, and worthy of praiseâ€”dwell on these things.</p>

  <p>Think about it: if all your thoughts are focused on things like those listed above, how in the world will you have time to stress over the negatives? Hint, hint: God checks off everything on that list.</p>
