  <h1>Born of the Spirit: Entering God's Family</h1>

  <p>"Nicodemus said to Him, 'How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he?'" - John 3:4</p>

  <p>Jesus tells us that we must be born of water and the Spirit to enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:5). A religious man, Nicodemus replies perhaps similarly to how we do, "How are we to be born again?" It seems impossible. Well, the truth is that Jesus was speaking of spiritual birth, unlike Nicodemus, who was imagining being born in the flesh again.</p>

  <p>“That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." - John 3:6</p>

  <p>We are born of the Spirit, referring to God, which is why the letter is capitalized in the verse above. Plus, the Bible tells us that God is spirit (John 4:24).</p>

  <p>"Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him." - 1 John 5:1</p>

  <p>We are a part of God's family because of our belief in Jesus. To think that we can call God our Father is amazing!</p>
