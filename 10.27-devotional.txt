  <h1>Hospitality and the Heart: Reflecting God's Character</h1>

  <p>"Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it." - Hebrews 13:2</p>

  <p>Be careful how you treat people. It shows what is in your heart.</p>

  <p>"For there is no good tree which produces bad fruit, nor, on the other hand, a bad tree which produces good fruit. For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush. The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart." - Luke 6:43-45</p>

  <p>"A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of." - Luke 6:45</p>
