  <h1>Hospitality and the Heart: Reflecting God's Character</h1>

  <p>"Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by this some have entertained angels without knowing it." - Hebrews 13:2</p>

  <p>Be careful how you treat people. It shows what is in your heart.</p>

  <p>"For there is no good tree which produces bad fruit, nor, on the other hand, a bad tree which produces good fruit. For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a briar bush. The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth what is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth what is evil; for his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart." - Luke 6:43-45</p>
