  <h1>Chosen for Salvation: A Thanksgiving Message</h1>

  <p>"But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth." - 2 Thessalonians 2:13</p>

  <p>Thank You, Lord Jesus, that we were chosen by You for salvation! We rejoice in the fact that though problems come and go, one thing is certainâ€”our salvation! Lord, You paid the ultimate price to ensure that one day we'd be with You. For that, I'm truly thankful and just marvel at the love You have for us. It's crazy, all You did so that we can understand this. This world declares Your glory.</p>

  <p>Thank you to my friends, family, and anyone reading this during this month that we celebrate Thanksgiving! God bless you!</p>
