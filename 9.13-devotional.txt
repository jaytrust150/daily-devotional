  <h1>Doing Everything for God's Glory: Even When We Fail</h1>

  <p>Ever heard it said, “It's the thought that counts”?</p>

  <p>“So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything to the glory of God.” - 1 Corinthians 10:31</p>

  <p>I laugh at myself sometimes. Let me explain. Like, I've been doing stocks lately, and I'm trying to do a good job to bring God glory through my performance and maybe one day have a surplus to bless others in need.</p>

  <p>I imagine the people/whoever sees me, whether on earth or in heaven (Hebrews 12:1), seeing how bad I trade. Meanwhile, I'm here trying my best but probably doing a really bad job, missing obvious signals but not knowing any better, and they're scratching their heads.</p>

  <p>I laugh because I think I'm rocking it for the Lord, trying to represent Him, but I'm probably terrible at it, lol. The guys taking orders are probably like, “OMG, WTF is this guy doing? This thing is going to take off; it's so obvious!” But, of course, I'm clueless, lol.</p>

  <p>I laugh and smile at the same time because, regardless of the outcome, God sees our heart and our desire to bring God glory!</p>
