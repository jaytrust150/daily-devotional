  <h1>Walking by Faith, Not by Sight</h1>

  <p>"For we walk by faith, not by sight." - 2 Corinthians 5:7 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>Remember this verse for context as you read the rest of the chapter.</p>

  <p>The more you grow in the Lord spiritually, the more He reveals to you of His Word. Read this section of Scripture; it's amazing, especially now as you read it as a more mature Christian. Having known the Lord for this long, you now understand what the Lord is saying through His Word more clearly.</p>

  <p>Read this chapter on your own. As you read, remember all the capitalized pronouns refer to God, such as when they write "Him," "Spirit," etc.</p>
