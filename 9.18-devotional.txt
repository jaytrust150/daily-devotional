  <h1>The Good News of Salvation: God's Love and Justice</h1>

  <p>“Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were coming near Him to listen to Him. Both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble, saying, ‘This man receives sinners and eats with them.’ So He told them this parable, saying, ‘What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, “Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!” I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.’” - Luke 15:1-7 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>“I, the LORD, will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their sin. I will crush the arrogance of the proud and humble the pride of the mighty.” - Isaiah 13:11</p>

  <p>Punishing evildoers doesn't make you bad; it makes you a hero!</p>

  <p>Don't ever get it confused: our God is an awesome God who is very, very loving (He is love), but one day He will judge all the world. Are you saved?</p>

  <p>That's why we call the Gospel the good news! God has provided a way of salvation through Jesus Christ. Long story (the whole beginning of the Bible) short: it shows that man is incapable of living up to the holy standard God requires, the law. (Read Romans.)</p>

  <p>If you don't believe me, look at the Ten Commandments and see if you pass the test. We all fail. It's why we all die; we are born sinners in Adam. But if sin and death come through one man, Adam, then God would be equally fair to let righteousness and eternal life come from one man also, Jesus Christ (Romans 5:12-21).</p>

  <p>“Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.” - Galatians 3:24</p>

  <p>“But thank God! He gives us victory over sin and death through our Lord Jesus Christ.” - 1 Corinthians 15:57</p>

  <p>“You contribute nothing to your salvation except the sin that made it necessary.” - Jonathan Edwards</p>
