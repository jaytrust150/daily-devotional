  <h1>Jesus is for Everyone: No Religious Requirements</h1>

  <p>"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life." - John 3:16</p>

  <p>My faith in God has taught me one thing: Jesus is for everyone. I mean that. God—Jesus Christ—is for everyone. It doesn't matter what kind of music you listen to. How do I know? Well, look at my Facebook page, for example. I listen to all sorts of music, and guess what? I still have a relationship with God. Now, I know that not all things are profitable, but the point is, don't let anything stop you from having a relationship with God.</p>

  <p>Don't believe the lie that you have to be religious to have a relationship with God. You don't. You just have to have faith in Him and seek after Him! For a non-believer, a good starting point is the Bible. In it, we learn about God and who He is. What we discover is that He is the most awesome being ever! He gave us the clearest and ultimate expression of His love: He gave us Jesus. Through Jesus, we can get to know God. It just takes believing—no religious requirement, such as the need to listen to or stop listening to any kind of music. There isn't a need to dress a certain way or pray a certain number of times, etc. None of that. Just like the thief on the cross (Luke 23:32-43), he didn't even have time to get baptized, but Jesus promised him paradise after death. Be like the thief (the part where he believes in Jesus).</p>
