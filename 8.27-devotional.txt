  <h1>Love Like God: Unconditional and All-Encompassing</h1>

  <p>“Open rebuke is better than secret love. Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.” - Proverbs 27:5-7</p>

  <p>“If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.” - 1 Corinthians 13:1-3 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>Lord, let us love like you, unconditionally, everyone, not just those who deserve or earn our love, but even towards those people who hate or despise us, and use or take advantage of us. We want to be like you, conformed to your image (Romans 8:29).</p>

  <p>“so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.” - Matthew 5:45 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>For God is love; look how He treats the evil and the good in the verse above.</p>

  <p>“If someone says, ‘I love God,’ and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also.” - 1 John 4:20-21 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>Does that mean a brother or sister who attends a different church or denomination than we do? Yes, it does. Jesus goes as far as saying to love even your enemies, so of course you have to love your brothers and sisters in the Lord who attend other churches, who also confess Jesus is Lord, even if you disagree with them on different biblical issues, because, as the verses I started this post say, even if you can speak in tongues or know all the mysteries in the Bible and have all knowledge or do acts of kindness/religious works but have not love, it means nothing.</p>
