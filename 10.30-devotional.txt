  <h1>All Things Work Together for Good: Conformed to the Image of Christ</h1>

  <p>"And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose." - Romans 8:28</p>

  <p>We sometimes forget that "ALL THINGS" in the above verse includes even the bad moments in our lives. Now, I'm not saying that these bad things are good, but that God still uses them for the greater good of conforming us to Jesus, as the next verse explains. (The word in Greek literally means "having the same form as another.")</p>

  <p>"For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren." - Romans 8:29</p>
