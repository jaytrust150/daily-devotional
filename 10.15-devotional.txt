  <h1>Imitators of God: Growing Through His Word</h1>

  <p>“For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants for Jesus’ sake.” - 2 Corinthians 4:5 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>Paul commands us a few times elsewhere to be “imitators.” (“In context with the other Greek words used, it carries the meaning 'to become' in a continual and permanent sense.” - Vine’s Expository Dictionary)</p>

  <p>“Therefore I exhort you, be imitators of me.” - 1 Corinthians 4:16 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>“Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.” - 1 Corinthians 11:1 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>“Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children.” - Ephesians 5:1 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>“So that you will not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” - Hebrews 6:12 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>We need to read the Bible because that’s where we are told about Paul’s life, “God,” and “those who through faith and patience inherit the promises”—the very people Paul wants us to “imitate.”</p>

  <p>Remember, God gave His Church, also known as His Bride, the Bible and the precious promises it contains for a purpose.</p>

  <p>“So that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word.” - Ephesians 5:26 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>“For by these He has granted to us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.” - 2 Peter 1:4 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>“And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ; until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.” - Ephesians 4:11-13 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>“Like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation.” - 1 Peter 2:2 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.” - Romans 12:2 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>God wants to birth (1 Peter 1:23), prepare, cleanse, and transform His Bride, the Church, and He is using the Holy Spirit and other members of the body (who use the Bible) to equip His saints for the work of service, so they too can in turn help with the building up of the body of Christ until His return.</p>

  <p>Lord, Your Word never returns void, so I pray You give us an intense desire to read it and, as a result, grow to Your full stature.</p>

  <p>In Your mighty name, Lord Jesus, I pray! Amen. 🙏</p>
