  <h1>One Body, One Spirit: The Unity of Believers in Christ</h1>

  <p>“Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.” - Ephesians 4:1-6 (NASB95)</p>

  <p>Love how Paul speaks about us, the church, here. He clarifies that we are one body with one Spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father.</p>

  <p>As Christians (all Catholics are Christians, all Baptists are Christians, all non-denominations are Christian, etc.) who confess Jesus is Lord (Romans 10:9), we sometimes forget that all who call on the name of the Lord are our brothers and sisters who have the same Holy Spirit inside of them that we have. We were all baptized in the same name, etc.</p>

  <p>The point is, the Bible is very clear: we need to love each other the way Christ loves us (unconditionally).</p>

  <p>The below is what Jesus told his disciples:</p>

  <p>“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” - John 13:34-35 (NASB95)</p>
