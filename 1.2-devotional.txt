  <h1>The Call to Repentance</h1>

  <p>"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand." - Matthew 3:3</p> 

  <p>The call to repentance isn't someone trying to bring you down. It's someone trying to elevate you.</p>

  <p>Don't believe the lies; sin is never good. It's through sin that we, as human beings, encounter suffering, pain, and everything else that is wrong with this world.</p>

  <p>Repentance - A complete reversal of one's attitude and values; i.e., a turning toward God.</p>

  <p>My New Year's resolution this year is to leave behind bad habits and commit myself more to the Lord! I pray through His grace I'll be successful.</p>

  <p>"We must care for our bodies as though we are going to live forever, but we must care for our souls as if we are going to die tomorrow." - Unknown</p>
