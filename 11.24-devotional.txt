  <h1>God's Plea: Turn to Me and Be Saved (Part 1)</h1>

  <p>Have you ever heard God speak before?</p> 

  <p>Below, you can hear the voice of God speaking in the Old Testament through the prophet Isaiah long before He sent His Son to save mankind. The message is the same message God echoes throughout the New Testament: He is a righteous God and a Savior, and there is no other God besides Him.</p>

  <p>“Declare and set forth your case; Indeed, let them consult together. Who has announced this from of old? Who has long since declared it? Is it not I, the Lord? And there is no other God besides Me, A righteous God and a Savior; There is none except Me. 'Turn to Me and be saved, all the ends of the earth; For I am God, and there is no other. I have sworn by Myself, The word has gone forth from My mouth in righteousness And will not turn back, That to Me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear allegiance. They will say of Me, ‘Only in the Lord are righteousness and strength.’ Men will come to Him, And all who were angry at Him will be put to shame.” - Isaiah 45:21-24</p>

  <p>I hope to further elaborate on this soon... stay tuned! (Part 1 of 3)</p>
