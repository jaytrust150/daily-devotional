  <h1>Blessed Are Those: Finding Joy in God's Promises</h1>

  <p>My life as I get older, lol. What do I do for fun on a Friday night? Oh, easy: scroll through Facebook/hear random music, Christian teachings, and read the Bible. Surprisingly, I enjoy this, lol. Facebook/social media was one of the coolest things they have invented during our lifetime, I think (second to iPhones only), the ability to share whatever you want whenever. Feel very blessed to be able to always talk about God and His Word and share it! Anyway, here are some precious promises God has for us before I go to bed... zZz... Zzz...</p>

  <p>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
  Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.<br>
  Blessed are the gentle, for they will inherit the earth.<br>
  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.<br>
  Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.<br>
  Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.<br>
  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.<br>
  Blessed are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
  Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me.<br>
  Rejoice and be glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in this same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.”<br>
   - Matthew 5:3-12</p>
