  <h1>Created in God's Image: The Value of Humanity</h1>

  <p>"When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, The moon and the stars, which You have ordained; What is man that You take thought of him, And the son of man that You care for him?" - Psalm 8:3-4</p>

  <p>I pray that you will be blessed by the time you are done reading this post as I indirectly answer the above question from the perspective (point of view) of creation, seeing what the Bible has to say regarding creation and man. Let's begin by simply stating what John says about Jesus in the Gospel of John, then right away looking at the start of creation as detailed in Genesis.</p>

  <p>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being." - John 1:1-3</p>

  <p>"He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth." - John 1:10-15</p>

  <p>In the account of creation given in Genesis, a few things stand out. First, the fact that God created everything.</p>

  <p>"In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." - Genesis 1:1</p>

  <p>Second, the manner of how He did it (read Genesis 1). In the first chapter alone, over 10 times it states, "God said." He spoke it, and it happened.</p>

  <p>In the New Testament, we learn (quoted above) "all things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being" (John 1:3). It states "through whom also He made the world" (Hebrews 1:2), referring to Jesus. Not only was it through Jesus that God made the world, but it is also by Jesus that He "upholds all things through the power of His word" (Hebrews 1:4).</p>

  <p>Again, below the Bible says about Jesus:</p>

  <p>"He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authoritiesâ€”all things have been created through Him and for Him. He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together." - Colossians 1:15-17</p>

  <p>The Bible teaches clearly that it was through and for Jesus Christ that the world and everything as we know it exists (a very good thing) and continues to exist, being upheld "through the power of His word." This now begins to answer the question asked by the psalmist above.</p>

  <p>The third thing I notice when reading the creation account in Genesis is that God created several things "after their kind," whether referring to the plants or animals; it was always "after their kind" that He created them (Genesis 1:20-25). But mankind was different.</p>

  <p>"Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness...' " - Genesis 1:26</p>

  <p>"God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them." - Genesis 1:27</p>

  <p>When God finally created mankind, it was "in His own image," "according to Our likeness," it says. That tells us a lot about God. For example, all the things that are characteristic of human beings can be found and attributed to God: our ability to communicate, intelligence, things such as the emotions we feel, love, joy, anger, jealousy, creativity, etc., originate and can be seen and are displayed in God. God's personality can be seen throughout the Bible. Again, this lets us understand Him better since we were created in His image, and it also means we can be enabled to have fellowship with Him (Ephesians 5:25-32). I hope to speak more about this soon. Also interesting to note in passing is how God is using plural pronouns such as "Us" and "Our" when speaking about Himself (the concept of the Trinity), as well as the singular pronouns such as "His."</p>

  <p>Anyhow, the fact that we were created "in His own image" also helps to answer the question I began this post with: "What is man that You take thought of him...?" First and foremost, since we were created in God's image, it says that we as people are of immense value!</p>

  <p>Whether Christian or not, YOU were created in God's image! That's something to be very happy about. You are beautifully and wonderfully made after the most beautiful, wonderful, and glorious Being of them all, God Most High!</p>

  <p>So if you are feeling down or bad about yourself, remember, YOU have tremendous value!! You were created after God's own image, and that is something to smile about. "If you can't see that you are beautiful, YOU BETTER FIND ANOTHER MIRROR TO LOOK AT! Yours is broken!" And that's the truth.</p>
