  <h1>God's Everlasting Love: Known and Loved Before You Were Born</h1>

  <p>"The Lord appeared to him from afar, saying, 'I have loved you with an everlasting love; Therefore I have drawn you with loving-kindness.'" - Jeremiah 31:3</p>

  <p>"For You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother’s womb. I will give thanks to You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Wonderful are Your works, And my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth; Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; And in Your book were all written The days that were ordained for me, When as yet there was not one of them." - Psalm 139:13-16</p>

  <p>Do you know God? Pop culture and other influences have tried on many occasions to cast shade on God. They try to make God out to be some distant being who is very unacquainted (has never met) with us. Don't believe me? Well, when was the last time someone told you that God formed your inward parts, that He was the one who wove (put) you together in your mother's womb, and that you are fearfully and wonderfully made by God? Well, it's true. The Bible goes as far as saying that all of our days are written in His book, and regardless of Him knowing everything about us—having the biggest dirt on us—He still has "loved you with an everlasting love." Google the word "everlasting" if you really want to understand this. Again, He knows our past, present, and even our future, yet He still loves us with an EVERLASTING LOVE!!! I think this is why He created moms; they are the closest display of that type of love.</p>

  <p>We have a God who has utmost care for His creation. He knows everything about us—even the hairs on our heads are numbered (Luke 12:7)! So before it happens or you do it, God knows it. And the beauty of it is, He still chooses to love us despite our past, present flaws/mistakes, and even the future yet-to-be-committed sins. Knowing this makes me want to say, "I love You, Lord Jesus! Thanks for making this possible!" (Other religions would have a hard time explaining how God could love such sinful creatures. Christianity explains why this is possible!)</p>

  <p>"For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life." - Romans 5:6-10</p>
