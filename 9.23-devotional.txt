  <h1>True Riches: The Unseen Treasures of Faith</h1>

  <p>“By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward. By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen.” - Hebrews 11:24-27</p>

  <p>Do you understand the providence of God?</p>

  <p>Is it possible for a poor person with no food to eat to be more blessed than a rich person who has all the food and wealth anyone could dream of having? (Read the story of Lazarus - Luke 16:19-31.) The Bible teaches and answers overwhelmingly YES!</p>

  <p>If you don't understand this, you need to find a better church. (I say that jokingly, but if your church just talks about financial blessings all the time, you might be wasting your time if you are trying to be built up—aside from worship, you can do that anywhere, so keep going to worship at least!)</p>

  <p>Don't be deceived. Being blessed doesn't mean getting money (though it could be), but there is so much more. I pray you are going to a church that is teaching you the Word of God in its entirety! If you are praying for a monetary blessing, amen! Let God bless you. But my hope and prayer for you is a greater blessing that surpasses “monetary” blessings. This happens to be my prayer for me as well! Amen.</p>

  <p>“This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.” - John 17:3</p>
