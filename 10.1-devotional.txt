  <h1>Giving in Secret: The Reward of God</h1>

  <p>"But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you." - Matthew 6:3-4</p>

  <p>What Jesus taught His disciples and what He still teaches us is remarkable. He taught that when we do good, we do it for goodness' sake, not to be seen or admired by others (because if that's our goal, then congratulations, you have your reward in that). But when you do it in secret, then God can and will reward you.</p>

  <p>Now, this does not mean that when we do good, others won't notice. That's something you cannot control. In fact, we should be walking in a manner where the world can't help but notice us.</p>

  <p>"Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven." - Matthew 5:16</p>

  <p>A man or woman of God can't help but be themselves, and what results is praise and glory to God because of it!</p>

  <p>"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them." - Ephesians 2:10</p>
