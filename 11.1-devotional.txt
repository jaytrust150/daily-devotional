  <h1>Children of God: Entering the Family Through Faith</h1>

  <p>“For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, 'Abba! Father!'” - Romans 8:14</p>

  <p>Jesus taught us to pray, "Our Father," a declaration of the relationship we have with God. So how do we enter into the family of God?</p>

  <p>"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His name, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God." - John 1:12-13</p>

  <p>One of the most beautiful aspects of the Christian faith is that our relationship with God begins simply with believing in Jesus Christ. It doesn't take walking on water or performing 101 activities or praying three times a day or any other religious practice. It's simply a belief in the name of Jesus Christ. Jesus is Lord, we proclaim! The goodness of God is demonstrated in Jesus Christ. Anyone who dares speak evil of God has never known Jesus Christ, who is God's exact representation (Hebrews 1:3).</p>
