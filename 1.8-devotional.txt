  <h1>God's Unfailing Love and Forgiveness</h1>

  <p>
    "Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old." - Isaiah 43:18
  </p>

  <p>
    Something I love about my God is that He is so amazingly loving! The Bible shows us a God that is beyond belief, a God who is incomparable, a God whom we can offend over and over again (in this lifetime only, and with consequences, of course), and yet He is willing to still forgive at the cost of His own suffering and expense (the cross).

  <p>
    "As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us." - Psalm 103:12
  </p>

  <p>
    How far is that? A song I like answers the question: from one hand to the other...
  </p>

  <p>
    â€œI, even I, am the one who wipes out your transgressions for My own sake, and I will not remember your sins." - Isaiah 43:25
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank You, Lord, for a new year and new beginnings, even after we mess up!
