  <h1>A Promise to Abraham: Blessing for All Nations (Part 1)</h1>

  <p>"In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice." - Genesis 22:18</p>

  <p>“For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life." - John 3:16</p>

  <p>Merry Christmas! I love how the entire world stops to give gifts on Christmas. Perhaps they don't know it, but this time is special to us Christ-ians because it's when we celebrate the birth of baby Jesus, the greatest gift God gave the world (John 3:16). This gift (Genesis 3:15) was promised to humanity as a result of Adam and Eve's sin. The Bible teaches that sin entered the world through Adam, and as a result, death through sin (Genesis 2:17; Romans 5:12).</p>

  <p>The first Scripture above is God reaffirming the promise He gave to Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:15), but this time He gave it as an oath to Abraham, known as the Father of our Faith (Romans 4:16). He is credited for the creation of monotheism—belief in one God—by atheists, Muslims, and actual believers who read the Bible.</p>

  <p>God's promise to Abraham was that Christ (the seed) would be a descendant of his and would result as a blessing to "all the nations" (not just the Jewish nation but "all the nations") (Genesis 22:18; Romans 4:16). Why would God do this for Abraham? Because Abraham proved faithful to trust God (faith) and obey Him (works) (James 2:14-26). To be clear, you DO NOT need to do works to be saved (Ephesians 2:1-9); works just SHOW you are saved—a big difference. We come to God by the blood of the Lamb; that's what makes us righteous/justified and begins this process to change us internally (not to turn us religious, but to make us more like Jesus, a.k.a. WWJD). Our lives should confirm our eternal salvation because our actions will be more and more like Jesus' actions. But to be clear, it's not our actions that save us (Ephesians 2:10).</p>

  <p>It's interesting that even the "unbelieving world testifies" that something happened with Abraham that led him to stop being a pagan. This is where the origin of belief in one God started; history and archaeology attest to this (this is claimed by those who don't even read the Bible, and they are right...). The only thing is they get confused when they see worship of other gods by the Jewish people after the "God of glory appeared" to Abraham (Acts 7:2). That is all explained in the Bible, though. Anyhow, back to the topic at hand...</p>

  <p>God promised Abraham, at the start of the Bible, that in his "seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed."</p>

  <p>"In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice." - Genesis 22:18</p>

  <p>So back to where I started. If you've read this far, thank you, but you are now probably wondering why I started and finished my post with that verse? Well... you'll have to wait until next time to find out... (Part 1 of 2)</p>
