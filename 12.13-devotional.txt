  <h1>Submission to Authority: A Prayer for Humility and Obedience</h1>

  <p>‚ÄúLet every person be subject to the authorities over him, for there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are ordained by God. So then he who resists the authority opposes God‚Äôs ordination, and those who oppose will receive judgment to themselves.‚Äù - Romans 13:1-2</p>

  <p>Lord, forgive me when I don't subject myself to the authorities (people in places of authority). Help me humbly submit to Your ultimate will in my life. For You are God Most High, and my prayer is that I live a life pleasing to You and those who might observe it. I wish not to offend anyone and would be willing to lose in order to show this is the case. Father, I know I don't have to win in this life because You already won eternal life for me, and that is enough. I humbly submit to losing it all in order to show my love for You and anyone else my decisions might affect, negatively or positively.</p>

  <p>Please, Father, work all things out for the good of those reading this post. Let those reading know there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus! God has forgiven me and you, too, of all our sins (past, present, and future) if you confess Him as your Lord and Savior and just ask Him.</p>

  <p>Lord, I love You. Please forgive my sins as I forgive those who sin against me.</p>

  <p>In Jesus' name I pray,</p>

  <p>Amen üôè</p>
