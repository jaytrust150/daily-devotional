  <h1>Faith Like Abraham: Trusting God, Not Worldly Riches</h1>

  <p>“Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, ‘Give the people to me and take the possessions for yourself.’ But Abram said to the king of Sodom, ‘I have sworn to the LORD God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I will not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, so that you do not say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’ I will take nothing except what the young men have eaten, and the share of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their share.’” - Genesis 14:21-24</p>

  <p>One of my favorite parts of the Bible, this is also part of why Abraham was considered the “father of faith” (Romans 4:16). (Read Romans 3-4.)</p>

  <p>“But Abram said to the king of Sodom, ‘I have sworn to the LORD God Most High, Possessor of heaven and earth, that I will not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that is yours, so that you do not say, ‘I have made Abram rich.’” - Genesis 14:22</p>

  <p>That's how much faith I want to have in God, that I would turn down worldly riches offered to me by kings, because I know my God takes care of me. Yes, I understand that sometimes He uses natural means to bless us and even supernatural means, like in the story of Elijah, when a crow would bring him food to eat (sometimes we are called to be that crow, lol). But in this particular example of Abraham, Abraham wanted to make it clear to the worldly kings that his blessing would be from God, not from them. And he wanted to make it real clear, so he turned down anything that was offered to him by them (even though he helped them).</p>

  <p>Pretty amazing. Lord, give me that type of faith, that I would not depend on the world or anything/anyone but You! Jehovah-Jireh!</p>

  <p>“Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become foolish, so that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God. For it is written, ‘He is THE ONE WHO CATCHES THE WISE IN THEIR CRAFTINESS’; and again, ‘THE LORD KNOWS THE REASONINGS of the wise, THAT THEY ARE USELESS.’ So then let no one boast in men. For all things belong to you, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all things belong to you, and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.” - 1 Corinthians 3:18-22</p>
