  <h1>God's Persistent Love: Wooing Humanity with Kindness (Part 2)</h1>

  <p>God still speaks the same message through His disciples and apostles in the New Testament that He spoke in Isaiah (check yesterday's post):</p>

  <p>“We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.” - 2 Corinthians 5:20</p>

  <p>“The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up.” - 2 Peter 3:9</p>

  <p>“Or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness, forbearance and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness is intended to lead you to repentance?” - Romans 2:4</p>

  <p>If there is one thing the Bible makes clear throughout its entire presentation, beginning in Genesis (the first book of the Bible) and ending in Revelation (the last book of the Bible), it is that God loves mankind. It’s quite shocking and awe-inspiring, the great detail that God took in creation so that every relationship, when properly understood—such as marriage (Ephesians 5), the father-son relationship (Luke 11), our dependence on food (John 6) and water (John 4), etc.—serves to illustrate something God could use to teach us about Himself.</p>

  <p>Even David in Psalm 8 was amazed that in light of the moon and the stars (all the extravagances of creation), God was so mindful of mankind.</p>

  <p>“When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?” - Psalm 8:3-4</p>

  <p>I say all this to make a point. If any man is not saved, it is NOT because God didn’t try. He just wasn’t going to forcefully make us love Him. He’s like a man trying to win the love of a woman in courtship (look up the word). He doesn’t want to force us to love Him, nor does He reveal His full glory and beauty because then He knows everyone will want Him, like gold diggers when they see a man with wealth. God hides His glory.</p>

  <p>“Then Jesus told him, 'Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.'” - John 20:29</p>

  <p>We are blessed who believe without even seeing Him in His full glory and spectacle, the same spectacle (I can’t even find a word to adequately describe Him) and awesome wonder described in Revelation. When we finally see Him, we will be the happiest people in the world.</p>

  <p>“You make known to me the path of life; you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.” - Psalm 16:11</p>

  <p>Yet those who choose not to believe and who refuse such a great salvation will be weeping and gnashing their teeth, the Bible says, to describe their torment and great regret.</p>

  <p>“There will be weeping there, and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.” - Luke 13:28</p>

  <p>“How shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? This salvation, which was first announced by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.” - Hebrews 2:3</p>

  <p>When He finally reveals Himself, this will lead all men, even the wicked who never gave Him the time of day, to desire to bow the knee to Jesus and acknowledge Him as God.</p>

  <p>It is written: “'As surely as I live,' says the Lord, 'every knee will bow before me; every tongue will acknowledge God.'” - Romans 14:11</p>

  <p>Why will Jesus be bestowed such great honor and glory that every knee will bow before Him? (More on that next time... Part 2 of 3)</p>
