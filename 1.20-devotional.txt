<h1>Can We Trust the Bible?</h1>

<p>"For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us; And the government will rest on His shoulders; And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace." - Isaiah 9:6</p>

<p>Can we trust the Bible? It makes sense logically as a theological system... But what happens when a friend of yours says, "It's been changed!" For one, you can point them to the Dead Sea Scrolls! Archeological evidence that our Bible is authentic to the timeline (written before Christ, unchanged to our modern text, predicting the birth of Jesus Christ as the verse I started with says!)</p>

<p>The truth is... A lot of folks have been lied to. In particular, a Muslim friend of mine was told that Jesus being God was something the early church invented. Anyone with some knowledge of the Old Testament can show why that isn't true. From the start of the Bible, God planned for Jesus to bless the nations (Genesis 22:18)! You find the prophets of God long before the prophet Mohammed was born and even Jesus Himself being born, declaring that God will be born! Don't get me wrong, believe whatever you want, but don't be deceived! #themoreyouknow #truthmatters</p>
