  <h1>Overcoming Death: The Victory of Christ</h1>

  <p>"O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law; but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." - 1 Corinthians 15:55-57</p>

  <p>"What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all things? Who will bring a charge against Godâ€™s elect? God is the one who justifies; who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us. Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Just as it is written, 'For Your sake we are being put to death all day long; We were considered as sheep to be slaughtered.' But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." - Romans 8:31-39</p>

  <p>Someone reading this might be wondering, "Jonathan, why are you picking those verses?" Well, it's the same reason why I always pick verses:</p>

  <p>"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ." - Ephesians 4:12</p>

  <p>You see, we the believers are the body of Christ (all of us as individuals, members forming the body of Christ) (1 Corinthians 12:27), so I post to hopefully help edify (build up) and encourage you who are reading this, as well as myself.</p>

  <p>As human beings, we are going to face challenges in this life, and one of the greatest challenges people will have to face is death (which is why some even fear death).</p>

  <p>We all will have to give an account one day (Romans 14:12), and that will be the most challenging of circumstances for some people, especially those who will have to answer for sin. Yet we the believers have overcome the greatest challenge any human can experience (death) because of Christ. In light of that fact, it's the reason why we Christians can endure whatever difficulty life holds or challenges you may be facing. (Maybe even a terminal disease.) Do not fear or fret, for the Scripture declares it plainly: God is for us! He who did not spare His own Son for us! Go ahead and read the top verses again!</p>
