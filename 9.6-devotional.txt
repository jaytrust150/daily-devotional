  <h1>God Is Love: A Portrait of His Character</h1>

  <p>“Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away.” - 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 (NASB)</p>

  <p>“When God saw what they had done and how they had put a stop to their evil ways, he changed his mind and did not carry out the destruction He had threatened. This change of plans greatly upset Jonah, and he became very angry. So he complained to the Lord about it: ‘Didn’t I say before I left home that you would do this, Lord? That is why I ran away to Tarshish! I knew that you are a merciful and compassionate God, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love. You are eager to turn back from destroying people.’” - Jonah 3:10-4:1 (NLT)</p>

  <p>I find it heartbreaking when people who never read the Bible are horribly misled by other people who take Scriptures out of context to paint a false picture of God. They make false statements like, “The God of the Old Testament is angry, but the God of the New Testament that Jesus reveals is loving; they are not the same God being spoken of,” or just as bad when they say stuff like, “God killed a lot of people in the Old Testament, and He hates mankind and wants to send people to hell.” Both those statements are terribly inaccurate and falsely represent the most loving being in existence. God actually wants all people to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth (1 Timothy 2:4).</p>

  <p>As you can see from the Scripture above in the story of Jonah in the Old Testament (the part of the Bible before Jesus was born), the reason Jonah ran away from preaching the Word of God was because he didn't want the people to whom he was sent to preach to repent and turn to God. He instead wanted God to punish them, but that's not God's heart. God is “a merciful and compassionate God, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love.”</p>

  <p>From 1 Corinthians 13, we can see what God truly is like using the Bible's description of love. Keep in mind the Bible tells us God is love, so the Bible's description of love is a picture of Christ, who is the “exact representation (Hebrews 1:3)” of God, who is love (1 John 4:8)!</p>

  <p>For us to see how God truly is like, just replace the word “love” with “God,” and you can see a picture of what God is like.</p>

  <p><b>God</b> is patient, <b>God</b> is kind and is not jealous; <b>God</b> does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; He does not seek His own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. <b>God</b> never fails. - From 1 Corinthians 13, with the word “God” substituted instead of “love.” </p>

  <p>“But anyone who does not love does not know God, for God is love.” - 1 John 4:8</p>
